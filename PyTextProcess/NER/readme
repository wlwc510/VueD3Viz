For the experiment conducted by Dai

#0: prepare the remote sensing datasets using the search conditions. (350 abstracts from the literatures)

#1: tagging the "belong and not belong to sensors" using 1 and 0 for the sentences. 

#2: tagging the "belong and not belong to applications" using 0 and 1 for the sentences.

#3: classifying the sentences using the feature extraction methods and classifers
    Feature extractions indclude word2vec, do2vec, bert
    classfiers include SVM, NB, and LR.
    Classi combination using the voting principle
    
#4: using NER methods BiLSTM, CRF, and word2vec to identify the sensor names and application key phrase.
