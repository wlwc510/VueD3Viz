0,1-1,The ionospheric delay of global navigation satellite systems (GNSS) signals typically is compensated by adding a correction value to the pseudorange measurement.
1,1-2,We examine the ionospheric signal distortion beyond a constant delay.
2,1-3,These effects become increasingly significant with increasing signal bandwidth and hence more critical for the new broadband navigation signals.
3,1-4,"By simulation, we first demonstrate that the signal modulation constellation diagram is particularly susceptible to the influence of the ionosphere already at moderate electron content."
4,1-5,"Using high gain antenna measurements of the Galileo E5 signal, we then verify that the expected influence can indeed be observed and compensated."
5,1-6,A new method based on a binned maximum likelihood estimator is derived to estimate the total electron content (TEC) from a single frequency high gain antenna measurement of a broadband GNSS signal.
6,1-7,Results of the estimation process are presented and discussed comparing to common TEC products such as TEC maps and dual-frequency receiver estimates.
7,10-1,"Defoliation by herbivorous insects is a widespread forest disturbance driver, affecting global forest health and ecosystem dynamics."
8,10-2,"Compared with time- and labor-intensive field surveys, remote sensing provides the only realistic approach to mapping canopy defoliation by herbivorous insects over large spatial and temporal scales."
9,10-3,"However, the spectral and structural signatures of defoliation by insects at the individual tree level have not been well studied."
10,10-4,"Additionally, the predictive power of spectral and structural metrics for mapping canopy defoliation has seldom been compared."
11,10-5,These critical knowledge gaps prevent us from consistently detecting and mapping canopy defoliation by herbivorous insects across multiple scales.
12,10-6,"During the peak of a gypsy moth outbreak in Long Island, New York in summer 2016, we leveraged bi-temporal airborne imaging spectroscopy (IS, i.e., hyperspectral imaging) and LiDAR measurements at 1 m spatial resolution to explore the spectral and structural signatures of canopy defoliation in a mixed oak-pine forest."
13,10-7,We determined that red edge and near-infrared spectral regions within the IS data were most sensitive to crown-scale defoliation severity.
14,10-8,"LiDAR measurements including B70 (i.e., 70th bincentile height), intensity skewness, and kurtosis were effectively able to detect structural changes caused by herbivorous insects."
15,10-9,"In addition to canopy leaf loss, increased exposure of understory and non-photosynthetic materials contributed to the detected spectral and structural signatures."
16,10-10,"Comparing the ability of individual sensors to map canopy defoliation, the LiDAR-only Ordinary Least-Square (OLS) model performed better than the IS-only model (Adj. R-squared = 0.77, RMSE = 15.37% vs. Adj. Rsquared = 0.63, RMSE = 19.11%)."
17,10-11,"The IS + LiDAR model improved on performance of the individual sensors (Adj. R-squared = 0.81, RMSE = 14.46%)."
18,10-12,Our study improves our understanding of spectral and structural signatures of defoliation by herbivorous insects and presents a novel approach for mapping insect defoliation at the individual tree level.
19,10-13,"Additionally, with the current and next generation of spaceborne sensors (e.g., WorldView-3, Landsat, Sentinel-2, HyspIRI, and GEDI), higher accuracy and frequent monitoring of insect defoliation may become more feasible across a range of spatial scales, which are critical for ecological research and management of forest resources including the economic consequences of forest insect infestations (e.g., reduced growth and increased mortality), as well as for informing and testing of carbon cycle models."
20,100-1,"Atmospheric soundings from radiosondes are critical for the weather forecasting, particularly for the diagnostic of atmospheric stability conditions that can lead to thunderstorm development."
21,100-2,"However, radiosonde observations (RAOBs) are temporally and spatially limited throughout the globe, promoting the use of satellite measurements."
22,100-3,This paper assesses the applicability to the operational short-term weather forecasting of atmospheric stability indices and parameters (SIPs) derived from thermodynamic profiles retrieved from the National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration Unique Combined Atmospheric Processing System (NUCAPS) using the Suomi National Polar-orbiting Partnership (SNPP) Cross-track Infrared Sounder (CrIS) and Advanced Technology Microwave Sounder (ATMS) radiances.
23,100-4,"For this purpose, we validated NUCAPS SIPs against SIPs derived from conventional and dedicated/reference RAOBs collocated with NUCAPS retrievals within a maximum radius of 50 km and +/- 1-h time difference, over midlatitudes (60 degrees N-30 degrees N) and tropics (30 degrees N-30 degrees S)."
24,100-5,"Stability parameters evaluated include total precipitable water (TPW), lifted index, K-index, total-totals index, and Galvez-Davison index."
25,100-6,"NUCAPS TPW exhibited the highest level of statistical agreement with RAOBs, with the remaining NUCAPS SIPs exhibiting favorable results (linear correlations ranging between 0.65 and 0.85)."
26,100-7,"Case studies over the Texas/Oklahoma region and the Northern Coast of Brazil demonstrate NUCAPS capability of generating reliable fields of atmospheric stability, as well as capturing synoptic-scale convective signatures, not feasible with RAOBs."
27,100-8,"Considering also the benefit of SNPP NUCAPS hyperspectral-infrared (IR) and microwave soundings available for both regions during critical early afternoon periods, our analysis supports the use of NUCAPS CrIS/ATMS SIPs as complementary nowcasting tools for the analysis of preconvective environments."
28,101-1,"Together with the continuous development of passive microwave surface soil moisture (SSM) products from newly launched satellites, it is necessary to perform reliable validations to assess their accuracy."
29,101-2,"With this aim, a new ""bottom-up"" validation approach is proposed based on the synergistic use of in situ SSM measurements from the soil moisture measurement station network (REMEDHUS) of the University of Salamanca, Salamanca, Spain, and optical/thermal infrared observations over 18 cloud-free days from Landsat-8."
30,101-3,An SSM estimation method using the boundary information from the land surface temperature and normalized difference vegetation index triangle space was developed for regional SSM mapping.
31,101-4,"The retrieved SSM reached a relatively good performance (mean R 2 and rootmean-squared error of 0.64 and 0.033 ne/m(3), respectively)."
32,101-5,"Then, the regional SSM was aggregated into the grid-cell scale of the Advanced Microwave Scanning Radiometer 2 (AMSR2) L3 high-resolution (0.1 degrees /10 km) soil moisture product to validate it both at network and grid-cell levels."
33,101-6,"At the network level, the derived regional SSM showed a good agreement with the averaged in situ measurements over the network (R = 0.731)."
34,101-7,"However, at the grid-cell level, small variations were observed for the cells over the network between the estimates and the AMSR2 product, with negative biases (-0.044 to -0.090 m(3)/m(3)) and positive correlations (R > 0.25) for most cells."
35,101-8,"In addition, it is shown that the descending product has a slightly better performance than does the ascending one."
36,101-9,"The preliminary assessments suggested that the proposed method provides new insights into the validation of passive microwave soil moisture products, while avoiding the common issue related to the big disparity in spatial scales between satellite observation and in situ measurements."
37,102-1,"The global optimal solution (GOS) has proven to be very accurate for deriving water surface velocities from contemporaneous image pairs, but previous studies have used shore-based radars or satellite measurements with resolutions on the order of a kilometer or tens of meters to establish this."
38,102-2,"In contrast, the objective of this paper is to derive a GOS velocity field from infrared (IR) (3-5 mu m) images having a 1-m pixel size."
39,102-3,"Because IR images can frequently exhibit a low signalto-noise ratio, a newly developed GOS technique with a local similarity metric is used to retrieve velocities from such low-contrast data sets."
40,102-4,"To demonstrate the utility of this new method, we use airborne data collected in the tidal Potomac River over 11 days and spatially varying flood, ebb, and slack conditions."
41,102-5,The resulting GOS-derived velocity estimates are compared against acoustic Doppler current profiler (ADCP) measurements taken simultaneously with the airborne collections.
42,102-6,"Velocity magnitudes and directions are found to have GOS versus ADCP correlations of 0.93 and 0.99, respectively."
43,102-7,This high correlation suggests that the GOS technique may be applicable to a variety of lower contrast imagery that can now be collected by a low-altitude remotely controlled aircraft.
44,103-1,This paper proposes a novel method based on deformable dictionary learning for detecting the regions of change between multitemporal image pairs.
45,103-2,"We build on our previous work, which constructed a pair of dictionaries."
46,103-3,The main shortcoming of this method was its dependence on a large amount of training data.
47,103-4,"In practice, there is often a shortage of ground-truthed training images, which limits the expression capability of the resulting dictionaries."
48,103-5,"This paper overcomes this challenge by incorporating the concept of deformation, wherein each atom of a dictionary is no longer a simple image patch, but instead is a flexible image deformation function."
49,103-6,"This enables the creation of more expressive dictionaries, capable of generalizing to a far greater variety of image patterns, while using a far smaller amount of ground-truthed images for supervised dictionary training."
50,103-7,Deformation similarity is employed for patch matching to find the best set of atoms in the difference image (DI) dictionary for reconstructing image patches for a new input DI.
51,103-8,"Each such atom can be deformed to achieve a better match, thus extending generality while reducing the number of atoms needed in the dictionary."
52,103-9,Multiple deformed atoms are weighted and combined to hest reconstruct the input DI patch.
53,103-10,"Then, the same set of deformations and weights is projected to the corresponding atoms in the CD dictionary to obtain the output change-detection map."
54,103-11,Experiments in six realistic synthetic aperture radar data sets demonstrate the robustness and efficiency of the proposed method in comparison with five other state-of-the-art methods from the literature.
55,104-1,Methods to obtain accurate phenotypic data of the seedling stage of maize are receiving ever-increasing research attention because such data are very important for crop growth and for estimating crop yield.
56,104-2,"To obtain such data, we propose herein an algorithm that uses computer vision to accurately recognize maize seedlings from a digital image."
57,104-3,"First, the red-green-blue (RGB) images acquired by a manned ground vehicle (MGV) and an unmanned aerial vehicle (UAV) are transformed into grayscale image to clarify the details of the images, and the Otsu threshold-segmentation method, which is based on threshold optimization, is used to separate the maize seedlings from the soil background."
58,104-4,"Next, the external pressure method is used to segment the results of skeleton extraction."
59,104-5,"After removing the skeleton burr by using the skeleton-deburring method based on saliency theory, the principal component analysis is used to determine the direction of the principal axis of the maize-seedling skeleton."
60,104-6,The principal axis is then introduced as a reference to identify the direction angle of the principle axis in binary images.
61,104-7,This process allows us to obtain from RGB images the multiple plant parameters that characterize the maize seedling stage.
62,104-8,"To verify these statistical computer-generated results, we compare them with field measurements of the maize plots."
63,104-9,The result of applying the proposed algorithm to the MGV and UAV data sets correlate strongly (R = 0.77-0.86) with the manually collected data.
64,104-10,"An average of 0.014 s is required to calculate the number of maize seedlings in a plot from two images showing different vegetation coverage, which shows that the proposed algorithm is computationally efficient."
65,104-11,These results indicate that the proposed method provides accurate phenotypic data on maize seedlings.
66,105-1,The supervised deep networks have shown great potential in improving the classification performance.
67,105-2,"However, training these supervised deep networks is very challenging for hyperspectral image given the tact that usually only a small amount of labeled samples are available."
68,105-3,"In order to overcome this problem and enhance the discriminative ability of the network, in this paper, we propose a deep network architecture for a super-resolution (SR)-aided hyperspectral image classification with classwise loss (SRCL)."
69,105-4,"First, a three-layer SR convolutional neural network (SRCNN) is employed to reconstruct a high-resolution image from a low-resolution image."
70,105-5,"Second, an unsupervised triplet-pipeline CNN (TCNN) with an improved classwise loss is built to encourage intraclass similarity and interclass dissimilarity."
71,105-6,"Finally, SRCNN, TCNN, and a classification module are integrated to define the SRCL, which can be fine-tuned in an end-to-end manner with a small amount of training data."
72,105-7,"Experimental results on real hyperspectral images demonstrate that the proposed SRCL approach outperforms other state-of-the-art classification methods, especially for the task in which only a small amount of training data are available."
73,106-1,"Flood inundation probability is critical for situation awareness, flood mitigation, emergency response, and postevent damage assessment."
74,106-2,Current flood inundation mapping approaches can be categorized into real-time (RT) and near-RT (NRT) processes based on the timing of data acquisition.
75,106-3,"However, the intrinsic limitations of each category largely hamper their applications for flood mapping."
76,106-4,"Taking the 2015 South Carolina flood in downtown Columbia as a case study, this paper proposes a flood inundation reconstruction model by enhancing the NRT normalized difference water index (NDWI) derived from remote sensing imagery with the RT data including stream gauge readings and social media (tweets)."
77,106-5,"Splitting into three modules: water height module, global enhancement module, and local enhancement module, the proposed model first incorporates the gauge readings and the NDWI image to reconstruct a macroscale flood probability layer, which is then locally enhanced using the verified flood-related tweets."
78,106-6,The final output of the model matches well with the U.S.
79,106-7,Geological Survey inundation map and its surveyed high-water marks.
80,106-8,"Results suggest that by enhancing NRT imagery with RT data sources, the proposed flood inundation probability reconstruction model renders a more robust, spatially enhanced flood probability index for emergency responders to quickly identify areas in need of urgent attention."
81,107-1,Convolution neural network (CNN) utilizes alternating convolutional and pooling layers to learn representative spatial information when the training samples are sufficient.
82,107-2,"However, for pixelwise classification of hyperspectral image, some important information is neglected by CNN, such as the erased information by the pooling operation and the appearance information from lower layers."
83,107-3,"Moreover, the lack of training samples is a common situation in remote sensing area, which afflicts CNN with overfitting problem."
84,107-4,"To address the aforementioned issues, this paper designs an end-to-end deconvolution network with skip architecture to learn the spectral-spatial features."
85,107-5,"The proposed network starts with two branches, i.e., the spatial branch and spectral branch."
86,107-6,"In the spatial branch, a band selection layer is designed to reduce parameters and remit the overfitting problem, unpooling and deconvolution operations are utilized to recover the erased information of the pooling layers and learn pixelwise spatial representation hierarchically, and the skip architecture is constructed for merging the deep semantic information with the shallow appearance information."
87,107-7,"In the spectral branch, a contextual deep network is employed for learning deep spectral features."
88,107-8,Experimental results on three benchmark data sets reveal the competitive performance of the proposed approach over several related methods.
89,108-1,Pansharpening regards the fusion of a high-spatial resolution panchromatic image with a low-spatial resolution multispectral image.
90,108-2,One of the most debated topics about pansharpening is related to the quality assessment of fused products.
91,108-3,Two main assessment procedures are usually exploited in the literature: the reduced resolution validation and the full-resolution (FR) validation.
92,108-4,"The former has the advantage to be accurate, but the hypothesis of invariance among scales has to be assumed."
93,108-5,The latter overcomes this limitation but paying it with a lower accuracy.
94,108-6,"In this paper, we will focus on the FR assessment proposing an approach for estimating an overall quality index at FR by using multiscale FR measurements."
95,108-7,The problem is recast into the sequential Bayesian framework exploiting a Kalman filter to find its solution.
96,108-8,"The proposed procedure for quality evaluation has been tested on four real data sets acquired by the Pleiades, the GeoEye-1, the WorldView-3, and the WorldView-4 sensors assessing the quality of 19 pansharpened methods."
97,108-9,The proposed approach has demonstrated its superiority with respect to the benchmark consisting of state-of-the-art quality assessment procedures.
98,109-1,Accurate information about ocean surface currents is of high importance for many purposes.
99,109-2,"Traditional ways of measuring surface currents using instruments immersed in water are associated with various challenges, as well as high installation and maintenance costs."
100,109-3,Algorithms and hardware used to measure surface currents based on marine X-band radar images have been steadily improved during the recent decades.
101,109-4,"Such systems can now provide the user with current measurements with high accuracy in local areas of interest and with no need for underwater equipment, both from fixed sites and from moving installations, such as vessels."
102,109-5,The primary focus of the work presented in this paper is to examine the measurement accuracy of an X-band radar-based system.
103,109-6,"For this purpose, field trials have been arranged and data acquired from a fixed platform in the North Sea in November 2015 and December 2015 and from a research vessel in the Norwegian Sea and the Barents Sea in November 2016."
104,109-7,"Data are analyzed, measured time series are compared to reference measurements and tidal current models, and statistical estimates of the measurement accuracy are calculated."
105,109-8,"Root-mean-square measurement errors of 0.032 m/s and 9.1 degrees for magnitude and direction, respectively, are estimated for the fixed installation."
106,109-9,"Correlation coefficients are 0.93 and 0.94 for east-west and north-south components, respectively."
107,109-10,A pooled standard deviation of 0.059 m/s is estimated for the moving installation.
108,11-1,"Rugged terrain distorts optical remote sensing signals, and land-cover classification and biophysical parameter retrieval over mountainous regions must account for topographic effects."
109,11-2,"Therefore, topographic correction is a prerequisite for many remote sensing applications."
110,11-3,"In this study, we proposed a semi-physically based and simple topographic correction method for vegetation canopies based on path length correction (PLC)."
111,11-4,"The PLC method was derived from the solution to the classic radiative transfer equation, and the influence of terrain on the radiative transfer process within the canopy is explicitly considered, making PLC physically sound."
112,11-5,The radiative transfer equation was simplified to make PLC mathematically simple.
113,11-6,Near-nadir observations derived from a Landsat 8 Operational Land Imager (OLI) image covering a mountainous region and wide field-of-view observations derived from simulation using a canopy reflectance model were combined to test the PLC correction method.
114,11-7,Multi-criteria were used to provide objective evaluation results.
115,11-8,"The performances were compared to that of five other methods: CC, SCS + C, and SE, which are empirical parameter-based methods, and SCS and DS, which are semi-physical methods without empirical parameter."
116,11-9,All the six methods could significantly reduce the topographic effects.
117,11-10,"However, SCS showed obvious overcorrection for near-nadir observations."
118,11-11,The correction results from D-S showed an obvious positive bias.
119,11-12,"For near-nadir observations, the performance of PLC was comparable to the well-validated parameter-based methods."
120,11-13,"For wide field-of-view observations, PLC obviously outperformed all other methods."
121,11-14,"Because of the physical soundness and mathematical simplicity, PLC provides an efficient approach to correct the terrain-induced canopy BRDF distortion and will facilitate the exploitation of multi-angular information for biophysical parameter retrieval over mountainous regions."
122,110-1,"Satellite-observed surface temperatures over heterogeneous urban pixels are generally determined by viewing and illumination angles, as well as by 3-D geometries and component temperature distributions of urban surfaces."
123,110-2,This paper focuses on developing a Geometric model to simulate Urban Thermal Anisotropy considering overlaps of shadows on the ground for simplified neighborhoods (GUTA-osg).
124,110-3,A Boolean model and projections for buildings are used to calculate the average fractions of urban components in a field of view.
125,110-4,Simulation results derived from GUTA-osg are compared with those from the 3-D discrete anisotropic radiative transfer model.
126,110-5,"At view and solar zenith angles lower than 50 degrees, GUTA-osg can be applied to urban scenes of h/w < 2.0 (building-height-to-spacing ratio) with confidence where errors of the estimated fraction of walls and shaded ground are less than 0.1."
127,110-6,"As h/w increases, GUTA-osg performs well when applied to urban scenes with smaller building plan area index values (e.g., lambda(p) < 0.3 for h/w = 2.0-4.0)."
128,110-7,"GUTA-osg accurately simulates the anisotropy of airborne measured temperatures, with R-2 > 0.85 and root mean square errors < 0.8 K."
129,110-8,"Biases of the model can result from: 1) the neglect of shadows on walls cast by adjacent buildings and 2) model simplifications, including constant building heights and random distributions of building location and orientation."
130,110-9,"GUTA-osg uses urban morphologic indexes as inputs, and coefficient values can be derived by fitting against multiangular thermal infrared observations."
131,110-10,The model can be used to adjust the directional temperature to a common viewing geometry.
132,111-1,A method to assess global land surface water (fw) inundation dynamics was developed by exploiting the enhanced fw sensitivity of L-band (1.4 GHz) passive microwave observations from the Soil Moisture Active Passive (SMAP) mission.
133,111-2,The L-band fw (fw(LBand)) retrievals were derived using SMAP H-polarization brightness temperature (T-b) observations and predefined L-band reference microwave emissivities for water and land end-members.
134,111-3,Potential soil moisture and vegetation contributions to the microwave signal were represented from overlapping higher frequency T-b observations from AMSR2.
135,111-4,The resulting fw(LBand) global record has high temporal sampling (1-3 days) and 36-km spatial resolution.
136,111-5,"The fw(LBand) annual averages corresponded favorably (R = 0.85, p-value < 0.001) with a 250-m resolution static global water map (MOD44W) aggregated at the same spatial scale, while capturing significant inundation variations worldwide."
137,111-6,The monthly fw(LBand) averages also showed seasonal inundation changes consistent with river discharge records within six major US river basins.
138,111-7,"An uncertainty analysis indicated generally reliable fw(LBand) performance for major land cover areas and under low to moderate vegetation cover, but with lower accuracy for detecting water bodies covered by dense vegetation."
139,111-8,Finer resolution (30-m)fw(LBand) results were obtained for three sub-regions in North America using an empirical downscaling approach and ancillary global Water Occurrence Dataset (WOD) derived from the historical Landsat record.
140,111-9,"The resulting 30-m fw(LBand) retrievals showed favorable spatial accuracy for water (commission error 31.46%, omission error 30.20%) and land (commission error 0.87%, omission error 0.96%) classifications and seasonal wet and dry periods when compared to independent water maps derived from Landsat-8 imagery."
141,111-10,"The new fw(LBand) algorithms and continuing SMAP and AMSR2 operations provide for near real-time, multi-scale monitoring of global surface water inundation dynamics and potential flood risk."
142,112-1,"In cities, vegetation temperature is important for quantifying water use, microclimates, and water and energy fluxes, as demonstrated by urban climate models and in situ studies."
143,112-2,"Remote sensing is capable of observing land surface temperatures (LST) across a city; however, its ability to quantify vegetation canopy temperatures is limited because of LST variability resulting from urban surface heterogeneity, differences in vegetation fraction and non-vegetated material, and the coarse resolution of available thermal imagery."
144,112-3,"This study is a large-scale analysis of urban surface composition and temperature variability across the Los Angeles, USA, metropolitan area (4466 km(2))."
145,112-4,"Sub-pixel fractions of two plant functional types (tree and turfgrass) and four urban materials (impervious surface, commercial roof, non-photosynthetic vegetation, and soil) were quantified using hyperspectral imagery (Airborne Visible/Infrared Imaging Spectrometer)."
146,112-5,"Fractional cover gradients of plant types and non-vegetated materials were developed using 1.7 million pixels, from which we modeled LST changes using simultaneously collected thermal imagery (MODIS-ASTER Airborne Simulator)."
147,112-6,Vegetation LST variability was mapped by subtracting modeled LST from observed LST and investigated relative to building density and vegetation management.
148,112-7,"Overall, LST varied significantly among plant functional types and urban material types."
149,112-8,"Across heterogeneous mixtures, LST and vegetation fraction exhibited a negative, linear relationship, with the slopes of LST change showing significant differences between trees and turfgrass."
150,112-9,"The map of vegetation LST variability had a standard deviation of 3.5 degrees C, indicating significant variability across Los Angeles independent of vegetation type or fractional cover."
151,112-10,"Building density was observed to affect tree and turfgrass LST differently, while a negative relationship was observed between vegetation LST and irrigation (R-2 = 0.55)."
152,112-11,"Our results show that an LST signal of vegetation function, distinct from that of vegetation fractional cover, can be observed and modeled at city-scales in fractional mixture analysis, indicating potential for improved understanding of urban microclimates."
153,113-1,The proximity of seagrass meadows to centers of human activity makes them vulnerable to a variety of habitat degrading insults.
154,113-2,Physical scarring has long been recognized as an important but difficult-to-quantify source of habitat fragmentation and seagrass loss.
155,113-3,"We present a pixel-based algorithm to detect seafloor propeller seagrass scars in shallow water that promises to automate the detection and measurement of scars across the submarine landscape. (1)We applied the algorithm to multispectral and panchromatic images captured at the Deckle Beach, Florida using the WorldView-2 commercial satellite."
156,113-4,The algorithm involves four steps using spectral and spatial information from radiometrically calibrated multispectral and panchromatic images.
157,113-5,"First, we fused multispectral and panchromatic images using a principal component analysis (PCA)-based pan-sharpening method to obtain multispectral pan-sharpened bands."
158,113-6,"In the second step, we enhanced the image contrast of the pan-sharpened bands for better scar detection."
159,113-7,"In the third step, we classified the contrast enhanced image pixels into scar and non-scar categories based on a sparse coding algorithm that produced an initial scar map in which false positive scar pixels were also present."
160,113-8,"In the fourth step, we applied post-processing techniques including a morphological filter and local orientation to reduce false positives."
161,113-9,Our results show that the proposed method may be implemented on a regular basis to monitor changes in habitat characteristics of coastal waters.
162,114-1,"With the maturation of methods for estimating aboveground forest biomass by remote sensing, researchers increasingly need test data, particularly ground reference data, that are large enough to fine-tune existing approaches and test their robustness under diverse conditions."
163,114-2,"In this context, realistic synthetic datasets present an interesting alternative to costly and limited field data."
164,114-3,"Here, we present a new approach to simulate realistic canopy height and cover type data by combining an individual-tree forest simulator with real LiDAR point clouds of individual trees."
165,115-1,Land degradation (LD) is one of the most catastrophic outcomes of long-lasting drought events and anthropogenic activities.
166,115-2,Assessing climate and human-induced impacts on land can provide information for decision makers to mitigate the effects of these phenomena.
167,115-3,"The Northeastern region of Brazil (NEB) is the most populous dryland on the planet, making it a highly vulnerable ecosystem especially when considering the lingering drought that started in 2012."
168,115-4,The present work consisted of detecting trends in biomass [leaf area index (LAI)] anomalies as indicators of LD in NEB.
169,115-5,"We also assessed how the loss of vegetation impacts the LD cycle, by measuring trends in albedo and evapotranspiration (ET)."
170,115-6,"LAI, albedo and ET data were derived from MODIS sensors at 8-day temporal and 500 m spatial resolutions."
171,115-7,"For precipitation anomalies, we relied on CHIRPS-v2 10-day temporal at 5 km spatial resolution data."
172,115-8,"For detecting trends, we applied the Theil-Sen slope analysis on time series of MODIS LAI, albedo and ET images."
173,115-9,Trend analysis was performed for the periods ranging from 2002-2012 (no severe droughts) to 2002-2016 (including the last drought).
174,115-10,"LAI trends were more pronounced and had a stronger signal than ET and albedo, therefore, LAI was our choice for mapping LD."
175,115-11,The first analysis highlighted the human-induced LD prone areas whereas the last detected drought-induced LD prone areas.
176,115-12,"Considering only the trending areas, which was about 23.4% of the total, 4.5% of this area has undergone human-induced degradation whereas drought was responsible for 73%, although, not mutually exclusive."
177,115-13,"As reported in the literature and official data, grazing intensification might be a factor driving human-induced degradation."
178,115-14,"We noticed that the range of variation of LAI is narrow and even narrower for albedo, which demonstrates that land surface response is more influenced by soil reflectivity rather than the characteristic sparse vegetation coverage (LAI ranging from 0.04 to 0.4 in the Caatinga biome), which can barely alter albedo."
179,115-15,"Finally, the effects of LD on ET anomalies were assessed by Granger causality and impulse-response analyses as means to link land surface feature changes to the hydrological cycle."
180,115-16,Albedo had a slightly weaker impulse than LAI on ET whereas precipitation played a major role.
181,115-17,"These relations are site-specific and, land surface features (biomass and albedo) showed to have a more substantial influence on ET in severely degraded areas."
182,115-18,"We concluded that drought led to trends indicating LD prone areas in NEB and the degradation cycle has positive feedback derived from ET reduction resulting in an increased net moisture deficit, although the latter statement has yet to be further investigated."
183,115-19,The study warns of the desertification risk that NEB is facing and the need for the authorities to take action to mitigate degradation and drought effects on both traditionally surveyed (desertification nuclei) and newfound LD prone areas.
184,115-20,"We also highlight the limitation of confirming LD, as to date there is no post-drought data available and, lessons learned from the Sahel case make us cautious about claiming that an area is in fact degraded."
185,116-1,"Monitoring scene-level land-use in urban coastal zones has become a critical and challenging task, due to the rising risk of marine disasters and the greater number of scene classes such as harbors."
186,116-2,"Since street blocks are physical containers of different classes of land-use in urban zones, some scene classification methods based on high-spatial-resolution remote sensing images take blocks segmented by roads as classification units."
187,116-3,"However, these methods extract handcrafted low-level features from remote sensing images, limiting their ability to represent street blocks."
188,116-4,"To extract semantically meaningful representations of street blocks, the sparse auto-encoder (SAE) model was employed for local feature extraction in this paper and a multi-level method based on the fusion of local features was proposed for block-based land-use scene classification in urban coastal zones."
189,116-5,"First, convolved feature maps of street blocks were extracted by taking the hidden layer of the SAE as convolution kernels."
190,116-6,"Then, the local features were fused at three levels to generate more robust and discriminative representations of patches in convolved feature maps."
191,116-7,"The combination patterns and the absolute relationship of local features were captured at the first and second level, respectively."
192,116-8,A convolution neural network was utilized to make the local features more discriminative to semantic information at the third level.
193,116-9,"Finally, the bag-of-visual-words model was employed to generate global features for street blocks."
194,116-10,"The proposed method was tested for Qingdao, China using Gaofen-2 (GF-2) satellite images and an overall accuracy of 83.80% was achieved in the study area."
195,116-11,The classification results indicate that the proposed method in concert with GF-2 images has potential for accurately monitoring land-use scenes in urban coastal zones.
196,117-1,Numerous methods have been successfully applied to estimate the regional impervious surface dynamics based on spectral or spatial information from remote sensing imagery.
197,117-2,"However, previous methods mainly focused on mapping impervious surfaces at annual or decadal time scales."
198,117-3,"Few studies have attempted to map impervious surface dynamics at finer time scales, such as on a seasonal time scale using temporal information."
199,117-4,This study aims to map regional impervious surface dynamics on a seasonal time scale by using time series Landsat data.
200,117-5,"The semi-supervised support vector machine (SVM) algorithm was employed for classifying impervious surfaces based on temporal characteristics, which were derived from seasonal time series biophysical composition index (BCI) and seasonal time series modified normalized difference impervious surface index (NDISI)."
201,117-6,The proposed method was validated over the Wuhan urban agglomeration (WUA) in China from 2000 to 2016.
202,117-7,"The results showed that impervious surfaces in the Wuhan urban agglomeration increased from 903.24 km(2) in 2000 to 3989.49 km(2) in 2016, with an annual growth rate of 20.10%."
203,117-8,"Additionally, the proposed method yielded reasonable average overall classification accuracy (up to 88%)."
204,117-9,Our results demonstrated that the proposed method could accurately map seasonal impervious surface dynamics based on temporal characteristics.
205,117-10,This study could enable the monitoring of time-intensive impervious surfaces at a regional scale using remote sensing data.
206,118-1,"Leaf area index (LAI) is an important forest structural parameter that can be used to characterize various biophysical processes such as photosynthesis, evapotranspiration, and carbon flux."
207,118-2,Accurate monitoring of LAI therefore is crucial for efficient management of managed and natural vegetation ecosystems.
208,118-3,"Remote sensing techniques have proved useful in the quantification and monitoring of LAI in different vegetation types; however, most of the focus has been on vegetation with relatively large LAI ranges."
209,118-4,"This study aimed to investigate the utility of airborne light detection and ranging (lidar) data to estimate narrow-range LAI (min = 0.71, max = 1.56, mean = 1.08 +/- 0.18) of intensively-managed Eucalyptus grandis plantations."
210,118-5,The secondary aim of the study was to assess the effect of lidar point density on LAI retrieval.
211,118-6,Reference LAI was quantified in 15 m radius sample plots (n = 46) using hemispherical photography.
212,118-7,Akaike Information Criterion (AIC) regression was used to build candidate models that estimate LAI from lidar-derived height and density metrics.
213,118-8,"The correlations were investigated at different point densities, including the original (> 6 points/m(2)) and reduced density levels (0.25-5 points/m(2))."
214,118-9,"Candidate models returned adjusted coefficient of determination ((adj, R-2)) ranging between 0.65-0.83 (RMSE 7.0-10.0% of observed mean) depending on the number of predicting metrics included in the models."
215,118-10,"A model that had two non-collinear metrics was selected as a compromise model ((adj, R-2) = 0.67; RMSE = 9.7%); this model was comparable to the best model, which had many collinear metrics."
216,118-11,"Estimation accuracies were similar for lidar densities of the original, 2-5 points/m(2) and less accurate for 0.25-1 point/m(2)."
217,118-12,These findings demonstrated the capability of lidar in estimating observed LAI with low range and variation.
218,118-13,The study also suggests the efficacy of moderate lidar point densities acquired at relatively low-cost surveys in attaining acceptable LAI estimation accuracy.
219,119-1,"In semi-arid conditions, nitrogen (N) is the main limiting factor of crop yield after water, and its accurate quantification remains essential."
220,119-2,Recent studies have demonstrated that solar-induced chlorophyll fluorescence (SW) quantified from hyperspectral imagery is a reliable indicator of photosynthetic activity in the context of precision agriculture and for early stress detection purposes.
221,119-3,The role of fluorescence might be critical to our understanding of N levels due to its link with photosynthesis and the maximum rate of carboxylation (Vcmax) under stress.
222,119-4,The research presented here aimed to assess the contribution played by airborne-retrieved solar-induced chlorophyll fluorescence (SIF) to the retrieval of N under irrigated and rainfed Mediterranean conditions.
223,119-5,The study was carried out at three field sites used for wheat phenotyping purposes in Southern Spain during the 2015 and 2016 growing seasons.
224,119-6,Airborne campaigns acquired imagery with two hyperspectral cameras covering the 400-850 nm (20 cm resolution) and 950-1750 mn (50 cm resolution) spectral regions.
225,119-7,"The performance of multiple regression models built for N quantification with and without including the airborne-retrieved SIF was compared with the performance of models built with plant traits estimated by model inversion, and also with standard approaches based on single spectral indices."
226,119-8,"Results showed that the accuracy of the models for N retrieval increased when chlorophyll fluorescence was included (r(LOOCV )(2)>= 0.92; p < 0.0005) as compared to models only built with chlorophyll a + b (C-ab), dry matter (C-m) and equivalent water thickness (C-w) plant traits (r(LOOCV)(2) ranged from 0.68 to 0.77; p < 0.005)."
227,119-9,"Moreover, nitrogen indices (NIs) centered at 1510 nm yielded more reliable agreements with N concentration (r(2) = 0.69) than traditional chlorophyll indices (TCARI/ OSAVI r(2) = 0.45) and structural indices (NDVI r(2) = 0.57) calculated in the VNIR region."
228,119-10,"This work demonstrates that under irrigated and non-irrigated conditions, indicators directly linked with photosynthesis such as chlorophyll fluorescence improves predictions of N concentration."
229,12-1,"Near-surface specific humidity (q(a)) and air temperature (T-a) over the global ocean are important meteorological variables, but they cannot be retrieved directly from remote sensing."
230,12-2,Many efforts have been made to develop algorithms that derive q(a) and T-a from multisensor microwave and/or infrared observations using in situ measurements as training datasets.
231,12-3,"However, uncertainty remains large in the resultant q(a) and T-a retrievals."
232,12-4,"In this study, 147 moored surface buoys are used to examine how buoy measured q(a) and T-a are related to satellite microwave brightness temperature (Tb) on the spatial scale from the warm/humid tropics to the cold/dry high latitudes."
233,12-5,"It is found that the Tb - q(a) and Tb - T-a relations are structured along two distinct, near-linear bands, with the primary band in the warm/humid regime and a secondary (weaker) band in the cold/dry regime."
234,12-6,The step-like transition (or separation) between the two regimes occurs at 8-10 g kg(-1) for q(a) and 14-17 degrees C for T-a.
235,12-7,The evidence suggests that one algorithm may not be sufficient to extract q(a) and T-a from Tb in all regimes.
236,12-8,"Therefore, a high-latitude enhancement is added to the global algorithm so that the q(a) and T-a retrievals in the dry/cold regime can be specifically addressed."
237,12-9,"The new algorithms are applied to 11 microwave sensors, including SSM/I, SSMIS, and AMSU-A, from 1988 to 2016."
238,12-10,"Based on the 475,717 buoy collocations during the 29-year period, the retrieved q(a) and T-a have root-mean-square differences of 0.82 g kg(-1) and 0.51 degrees C, respectively."
239,120-1,Inhalation of airborne particulate matter (PM) is associated with a variety of adverse health outcomes.
240,120-2,"However, the relative toxicity of specific PM types-mixtures of particles of varying sizes, shapes, and chemical compositions-is not well understood."
241,120-3,"A major impediment has been the sparse distribution of surface sensors, especially those measuring speciated PM."
242,120-4,Aerosol remote sensing from Earth orbit offers the opportunity to improve our understanding of the health risks associated with different particle types and sources.
243,120-5,The Multi-angle Imaging SpectroRadiometer (MISR) instrument aboard NASA's Terra satellite has demonstrated the value of near-simultaneous observations of backscattered sunlight from multiple view angles for remote sensing of aerosol abundances and particle properties over land.
244,120-6,"The Multi-Angle Imager for Aerosols (MAIA) instrument, currently in development, improves on MISR's sensitivity to airborne particle composition by incorporating polarimetry and expanded spectral range."
245,120-7,"Spatiotemporal regression relationships generated using collocated surface monitor and chemical transport model data will be used to convert fractional aerosol optical depths retrieved from MAIA observations to near-surface PM10, PM2.5, and speciated PM2.5."
246,120-8,Health scientists on the MAIA team will use the resulting exposure estimates over globally distributed target areas to investigate the association of particle species with population health effects.
247,121-1,"Satellite remote sensing technology provides the only viable means for global monitoring of atmosphere systems, such as ozone."
248,121-2,"The ozone mapping and profiler suite (OMPS) onboard Suomi-NPP satellite, which was launched in the year 2011, has a primary purpose of measuring ozone."
249,121-3,"Suomi-NPP has been on operation for more than 3 years, and it is crucial to keep the satellite data precise and trusted."
250,121-4,"By using 17 months of satellite and ground-based total ozone column (TOC) data, this study performs an evaluation of OMPS products."
251,121-5,"Ozone monitoring instrument (OMI) data generated from a similar satellite instrument were also used to compare with the OMPS TOC data, and both the TOC products were generated using TOMS version 8.5 (TOMS-V8.5) algorithm."
252,121-6,"The evaluation consists of intercomparisons with groundbased Brewer measurements, similar satellite instruments, and accuracy analysis as a function of time and solar zenith angle."
253,121-7,"Results show that after 3 years of operation, OMPS-derived TOC data still have good correlation (R-2 > 0.99, RMSE = 1.51%) with ground-based measurements."
254,121-8,The results also give some evidence that the OMPS TOC data have better accuracy than those from OMI using the same algorithm.
255,122-1,"Nonrigid point set registration is a key technology in the field of remote sensing image registration, which is widely used in military and civil fields such as natural disaster damage assessment, agricultural and urban land-use planning, environmental quality monitoring, and ground target identification."
256,122-2,"We present a multifeature energy optimization framework and parameter adjustment-based nonrigid point set registration that has three contributions: (1) an energy optimization framework is designed to freely combine multiple features for estimating correspondences between two point sets, (2) the thin-plate spline and Gauss radial basis function transformation models can be optionally implemented for solving two-dimensional, three-dimensional, or higher-dimensional registration problems, and (3) the free parameters can be adjusted by the proposed three parameter adjustment approaches to yield higher registration accuracy in varied registration patterns."
257,122-3,"We test the performances of our method in contour point sets, sequence images, remote sensing images, medical images, and real images and compare with 10 state-of-the-art methods, where our method shows favorable performances in most scenarios."
258,123-1,Bayesian network classifiers (BNCs) are now among the most used supervised probabilistic methods for remote sensing image classification.
259,123-2,Our contribution lies in two principal points.
260,123-3,"First, the investigation of the applicability of Kruskal's algorithm constructs the optimal tree structure of multinet Bayeisan network classifier (MBNC)."
261,123-4,"Second, the focus on MBNC's advantages is over other classical BNCs, such as naive Bayes classifier (NBC), tree augmented naive Bayes classifier (TANC), forest augmented naive Bayes classifier (FANC), and state-of-the art competitor classifiers such as maximum likelihood classifier (MLC) and support vector machine (SVM) classifier."
262,123-5,"While classical BNCs have a mere network for all predefined classes, MBNC has as many local Bayesian networks as the predefined classes."
263,123-6,"Hence, through a statistical evaluation and a visual inspection, our objective is to emphasize the contribution of MBNC to enhance the accuracy of urban land cover map obtained by classification of remotely sensed image."
264,123-7,"Performances of developed BNCs (NBC, TANC, FANC, and MBNC) are experimentally assessed using a multispectral image acquired on July 12, 2010, by Alsat-2A Algerian satellite."
265,123-8,"Based on a confusion matrix, overall accuracy, and Kappa statistic, results indicate that MBNC largely outperforms classical BNCs (NBC, TANC, and FANC) and probabilistic MLC, but performs slightly better than an SVM classifier."
266,123-9,"Due to its specific-class local network, MBNC gives a powerful tool for a better discrimination between different correlated spectral classes."
267,124-1,"Several remote sensing proxies, such as image texture, have been used to describe the spatial variation of different tropical forest's attributes at medium scales."
268,124-2,Fourier transformed ordination (FOTO) and gray level co-occurrence matrix (GLCM) are two texture methods frequently used in these studies but seldom compared.
269,124-3,"Therefore, the objective of this study was to compare the potential of these metrics to describe and predict structural and diversity attributes of a tropical swamp forest located in southeast Mexico."
270,124-4,"FOTO and GLCM textures were extracted from the panchromatic (Pan) band, the near-infrared (NIR) and red (R), of a very high spatial resolution (VHSR) image."
271,124-5,Six different types of models that incorporated between one and three texture variables were constructed to describe each forest attribute.
272,124-6,Simpson (R-2 = 0.71) and Shannon (R-2 = 0.67) diversity indices followed by the aboveground biomass (R-2 = 0.65) were the attributes that obtained models with a higher goodness-of-fit values.
273,124-7,"In terms of its modeling potential, GLCM greatly surpassed FOTO textures."
274,124-8,Our results show that VHSR textures (especially R- and NIR-derived GLCM metrics) allow for a reliable estimation of important tropical swamp forest attributes associated with its diversity and structure.
275,125-1,"The Moderate Resolution Imaging Spectroradiometer (MODIS) instruments have successfully operated for more than 18 and 16 years, respectively, on-board the NASA's Earth Observing System Terra and Aqua spacecraft."
276,125-2,Both Terra and Aqua MODIS have significantly contributed to the advance of global Earth remote sensing applications with a broad range of science products that have been continuously produced since the beginning of each mission and freely distributed to users worldwide.
277,125-3,"MODIS collects data in 20 reflective solar bands (RSB) and 16 thermal emissive bands (TEB), covering wavelengths from 0.41 to 14.4 mu m."
278,125-4,"Its level IB (L1B) data products, which provide the input for the MODIS high-level science products, include the top of the atmosphere reflectance factors for the RSB, radiances for both the RSB and TEB, and associated uncertainty indices (UI) at a pixel-by-pixel level."
279,125-5,"This paper provides a brief review of MODIS L1B calibration algorithms, including a number of improvements made in recent years."
280,125-6,"It presents an update of sensor calibration uncertainty assessments with a focus on several new contributors resulting from on-orbit changes in sensor characteristics, approaches developed to address these changes, and the impact due to on-orbit changes on the L1B data quality."
281,125-7,"Also discussed are remaining challenges and potential improvements to be made to continuously maintain sensor calibration and data quality, particularly those related to the quality of MODIS LIB uncertainty."
282,126-1,"Hyperspectral images have the advantages of high spectral resolution and abundant spectral information, which helps researchers to analyze, process, and monitor land surface information."
283,126-2,"However, it also faces problems such as low degree of automatic data processing and poor timeliness of information extraction."
284,126-3,This timeliness is due to the high dimensionality when extracting the target information in hyperspectral image.
285,126-4,"To solve this problem, a practical real-time hyperspectral anomaly detection system enhanced by graphics processing unit (GPU) is designed."
286,126-5,"The push-broom imaging spectrometers are adopted to obtain the image data lineby-line; then, the real-time anomaly detection algorithm based on QR decomposition is optimized using GPU (i.e., A QR decomposition is a decomposition of a matrix A into a product A = QR of an orthogonal matrix Q and an upper triangular matrix R)."
287,126-6,The results show that the parallel algorithm based on GPU is up to about 26 times faster than the serial algorithm based on central processing unit.
288,126-7,This indicates that the proposed scheme significantly enhances the implementation efficiency while maintaining the accuracy of the results and can meet the application requirements of real-time anomaly detection well.
289,127-1,"Mapping of peanut crops is essential in supporting peanut production, yield prediction, and commodity forecasting."
290,127-2,"While ground-based surveys can be used over small areas, the development of remote-sensing technologies could provide rapid and inexpensive crop area estimates with high accuracy over large regions."
291,127-3,"Some of these recent earth observation satellite systems, such as the Project for On-Board Autonomy Vegetation (PROBA-V), have the advantage of increased spatial and temporal resolution."
292,127-4,"With a study area located in the South Burnett region, Queensland, Australia, the primary aim of this study was to assess the ability of time-series PROBA-V 100-m normalized difference vegetation index (NDVI) for peanut crop mapping."
293,127-5,"Two datasets, i.e., PROBA-V NDVI time-series imagery and the corresponding phenological parameters generated from TIMESAT data analysis technique, were classified using maximum likelihood classification, spectral angle mapper, and minimum distance classification algorithms."
294,127-6,"The results show that among all methods used, the application of MLC in PROBA-V NDVI time series produced very good overall accuracy, i.e., 92.75%, with producer and user accuracy of each class <= 78.79%."
295,127-7,"For all algorithms tested, the mapping of peanut cropping areas produced satisfactory classification results, i.e., 75.95% to 100%."
296,127-8,"Our study confirmed that the use of finer resolution 100 m of PROBA-V imagery (i.e., relative to MODIS 250-m data) has contributed to the success of mapping peanut and other crops in the study area."
297,128-1,The history of the development of works on the creation of the elemental base of adaptive optics for a solar Russian telescope is briefly described.
298,128-2,We consider separate issues of the development of the wavefront sensor (WFS) based on the Shack-Hartmann correlation sensor to provide measurements under conditions of strong turbulence.
299,128-3,The parameters of the WFS are calculated on the basis of long-term observations of meteorological characteristics and optical measurements of the Fried parameter.
300,128-4,A special adjusting device with a block of fast rasters changing is developed.
301,128-5,The use of rasters of various dimensions is provided in the WFS.
302,128-6,The sensor uses the original algorithm for determining the maximum of the correlation function.
303,128-7,The effect on the accuracy of measuring the phase distortions of turbulence occurring in the rooms of the telescope itself is analyzed.
304,129-1,A common method for synthesizing turbulent imagery is to model phase perturbations on a wavefront and then propagate the wavefront to the entrance pupil of an imaging system.
305,129-2,The point spread function (PSF) that results from the wavefront in the pupil is then computed and used to synthesize images by the usual means of convolution.
306,129-3,"In a recent publication, a method was disclosed using sparse and redundant dictionaries of turbulent characteristics to construct PSFs directly in the image plane and simulate image formation without making phase models and computing wavefront propagation."
307,129-4,"However, the dictionary method, as disclosed in the recent publication, is limited to modeling PSFs characterized by the Fried parameter of the data used to construct the dictionary."
308,129-5,"Herein, we demonstrate that a dictionary constructed from data with a given Fried parameter can be scaled to construct turbulent PSFs corresponding to larger and smaller values of the Fried parameter."
309,129-6,"This enables a single dictionary, or a small number of dictionaries, to serve for the simulation of turbulent images over a range of turbulence conditions."
310,13-1,"Urban geometry and materials combine to create complex spatial, temporal and directional patterns of longwave infrared (LWIR) radiation."
311,13-2,Effective anisotropy (or directional variability) of thermal radiance causes remote sensing (RS) derived urban surface temperatures to vary with RS view angles.
312,13-3,Here a new and novel method to resolve effective thermal anisotropy processes from LWIR camera observations is demonstrated at the Comprehensive Outdoor Scale MOdel (COSMO) test site.
313,13-4,Pixel-level differences of brightness temperatures reach 18.4 K within one hour of a 24-h study period.
314,13-5,"To understand this variability, the orientation and shadowing of surfaces is explored using the Discrete Anisotropic Radiative Transfer (DART) model and Blender three-dimensional (3D) rendering software."
315,13-6,Observed pixels and the entire canopy surface are classified in terms of surface orientation and illumination.
316,13-7,"To assess the variability of exitant longwave radiation (M-LW) from the 3D COSMO surface (M-LW(3D)), the observations are prescribed based on class."
317,13-8,The parameterisation is tested by simulating thermal images using a camera view model to determine camera perspectives of M-LW(3D) fluxes.
318,13-9,The mean brightness temperature differences per image (simulated and observed) are within 0.65 K throughout a 24-h period.
319,13-10,Pixel-level comparisons are possible with the high spatial resolution of M(LW)(3D )and DART camera view simulations.
320,13-11,"At this spatial scale ( < 0.10 m), shadow hysteresis, surface sky view factor and building edge effects are not completely resolved by M-LW(3D)."
321,13-12,"By simulating apparent brightness temperatures from multiple view directions, effective thermal anisotropy of M(LW)(3D )is shown to be up to 6.18 K."
322,13-13,The developed methods can be extended to resolve some of the identified sources of sub-facet variability in realistic urban settings.
323,13-14,The extension of DART to the interpretation of ground-based RS is shown to be promising.
324,130-1,Deep learning has been applied to many fields due to its capability for unsupervised feature learning.
325,130-2,"However, it is unsuitable for remote sensing image classification of deep convolutional networks due to the regular and fixed shape of receptive fields in current methods, which cannot freely adapt for ground objects with various shapes and scales."
326,130-3,"To tackle this problem, we propose object-based deep convolutional autoencoders (ODCAEs) to encode high-resolution remote sensing image features automatically."
327,130-4,"The receptive fields of deep convolutional autoencoders were designed based on a fractal net evolution approach to adapt for various ground objects in images, retaining category purity while providing adequate information."
328,130-5,"We collected 109,333 samples of seven classes from high-resolution satellite images over various locations to train the ODCAE, which encoded high level features automatically, coupled with a support vector machine for classification."
329,130-6,We assessed the classification results using two WorldView-II image locations.
330,130-7,The proposed ODCAE approach achieved higher accuracy than three manual design feature systems.
331,130-8,"Thus, the proposed ODCAE approach is useful and efficient for feature learning problems for high-resolution remote sensing images."
332,131-1,"Following the Kumamoto earthquake in April 2016, landslides occurred in the Minamiaso village of Japan."
333,131-2,Classification of remotely sensed imagery has been useful for mapping of the landslide area.
334,131-3,Many studies have focused on using object-based classification of the imagery to derive landslide maps.
335,131-4,"Also, those studies used shape or texture analysis, which requires significant time and labor, and expensive commercial software."
336,131-5,The purpose of this research was to develop a methodology to map the landslide area rapidly and economically using object-based classification with true color satellite images.
337,131-6,"Publicly available, RapidEye images taken before and after the landslide were used to save cost."
338,131-7,"Segmentation of the imagery was completed with the mean shift algorithm in the open source noncommercial remote sensing software, Orfeo toolbox."
339,131-8,"In addition, a maximum likelihood classification tool was built in a Python framework (open source freeware) to classify the objects created from Orfeo toolbox."
340,131-9,"For initial classification of each RapidEye image for both pre- and post-landslide, the overall accuracies were 91% and 88%, and Kappa statistics were 0.89 and 0.85, respectively."
341,131-10,"The landslide area was estimated as 979,815 m(2) with an accuracy of 98% after human-guided refinement of the landslide features."
342,131-11,"Every procedure was implemented using open source remote sensing or geographic information system technologies, which provided cost efficiency while simultaneously providing freedom from commercial license restrictions."
343,131-12,"Also, these open source technologies provided highly flexible interoperability with a classification framework developed using Python."
344,132-1,A new closed-form expression is derived in this paper for computing the electromagnetic field reflected by two moving parallel interfaces.
345,132-2,"Next, the interfaces velocities and refractive index between interfaces are derived from measurable frequencies and amplitudes embedded in the reflected electromagnetic field."
346,132-3,"As an application, the remote analysis of the shock wave phenomenon in solids is reported and shock wave descriptors are estimated."
347,132-4,"Based on the proposed approach, physical insights on measurement published results are reported."
348,132-5,"Moreover, new measurement data on shocked polymethyl methacrylate material are presented and discussed."
349,133-1,"In the last 10 years, development in robotics, computer vision, and sensor technology has provided new spectral remote sensing tools to capture unprecedented ultra-high spatial and high spectral resolution with unmanned aerial vehicles (UAVs)."
350,133-2,"This development has led to a revolution in geospatial data collection in which not only few specialist data providers collect and deliver remotely sensed data, but a whole diverse community is potentially able to gather geospatial data that fit their needs."
351,133-3,"However, the diversification of sensing systems and user applications challenges the common application of good practice procedures that ensure the quality of the data."
352,133-4,This challenge can only be met by establishing and communicating common procedures that have had demonstrated success in scientific experiments and operational demonstrations.
353,133-5,"In this review, we evaluate the state-of-the-art methods in UAV spectral remote sensing and discuss sensor technology, measurement procedures, geometric processing, and radiometric calibration based on the literature and more than a decade of experimentation."
354,133-6,"We follow the journey' of the reflected energy from the particle in the environment to its representation as a pixel in a 2D or 2.5D map, or 3D spectral point cloud."
355,133-7,"Additionally, we reflect on the current revolution in remote sensing, and identify trends, potential opportunities, and limitations."
356,134-1,"Spatial distribution and dynamics of intertidal habitats are integral elements of the Wadden Sea ecosystem, essential for the preservation of ecosystem functions and interlocked with geomorphological processes."
357,134-2,"Protection and monitoring of the Wadden Sea is mandatory and remote sensing is required to survey the extensive, often inaccessible tidal area."
358,134-3,Mainly airborne techniques are carried out for decades.
359,134-4,High-resolution satellite-borne sensors now enable new possibilities with satellite synthetic aperture radar (SAR) offering high availability of acquisitions during low water time due to independence from daylight and cloud cover.
360,134-5,More than 100 TerraSAR-X images from 2009 to 2016 were used to examine the reproduction of intertidal habitats and macrostructures from the flats south of the island of Norderney and comparative areas in the Lower Saxony Wadden Sea.
361,134-6,"As a non-specific, generic approach to distinguish various and variable surface types continuously influenced by tidal dynamics, visual analysis was chosen which was supported by extensive in situ data."
362,134-7,"This technically unsophisticated access enabled us to identify mussel beds, fields of shell-detritus, gully structures, mud fields, and bedforms, the latter detected in the upper flats of every East Frisian island."
363,134-8,"Based on the high frequency of TerraSAR-X recordings for the Norderney area, a bedform shift was observed in a time-series from 2009 to 2015."
364,134-9,"For the same period, the development of a mud field with an adjoining depression was traced."
365,134-10,"Beside seasonal variations of the mud field, the formation of a mussel bed settling in the depression was imaged over the years."
366,134-11,This study exemplifies the relevance of TerraSAR-X imagery for Wadden Sea remote sensing.
367,134-12,Further development of classification methods for current SAR data together with open access availability should contribute to large-scale surveys of intertidal surface structures of geomorphic or biogenic origin and improve monitoring and long-term ecological research in the Wadden Sea and related tidal areas.
368,135-1,SAR sensors are usually used in the offshore domain to detect marine oil slicks which allows the authorities to guide cleanup operations or prosecute polluters.
369,135-2,"As radar imagery can be used any time of day or year and in almost any weather conditions, the use and programming of such remote sensing data is usually favored over optical imagery."
370,135-3,"Nevertheless, images collected in the optical domain provide access to key information not accessible today by SAR instruments, such as the thickness or the amount of pollutant."
371,135-4,"To address this knowledge gap, a methodology based on the joint use of a scattering model (U-WCA) and remote sensing data collected by a low frequency (e.g., L-band) imaging radar over controlled release of mineral oil spill is reported in this paper."
372,135-5,The proposed method allows estimation of the concentration of pollutant within an oil-in-water mixture as well as the temporal variation of this quantity due to weathering processes.
373,136-1,"This study examined the relationship between foliar isoprene emissions, light use efficiency and photochemical reflectance index (PRI) throughout the canopy profile and explored the contribution of xanthophyll cycle pigments versus other carotenoid pigments to the isoprene/PRI relationship."
374,136-2,Foliar isoprene emissions within the canopy profile were measured in a high-density poplar plantation in Flanders (Belgium) during the 2016 growing season.
375,136-3,The results confirmed that PRI was a promising estimator of isoprene emissions at canopy level.
376,136-4,"Interestingly, xanthophyll cycle pigments contributed more to isoprene biosynthesis than chlorophyll and drove the isoprene/PRI relationship."
377,136-5,"The simple independent pigment index and novel defined indices, such as the hyperspectral isoprene index and simple hyperspectral isoprene index, showed promising results and could be suitable estimators of isoprene emissions due to their strong relationship with the xanthophyll pool."
378,137-1,"In this study, we apply high-resolution Sentinel-2A imagery to assist in the monitoring of the southwestern Spanish coast during its first year of data."
379,137-2,The aim is to test suitability of MultiSpectral Imager (MSI) at higher resolution (10 m) for mapping Total Suspended Solids (TSS).
380,137-3,"Several field campaigns are carried out to collect TSS at three different sites in the Guadalquivir estuary, Cadiz Bay and Conil port."
381,137-4,A regional multi-conditional remote sensing algorithm with a switching method that automatically selects the most sensitive TSS vs. water reflectance relationship is developed to estimate TSS concentration while avoiding saturation effects.
382,137-5,"An existing semi-analytical algorithm is calibrated by means of a cross-validation procedure based on both red 664 nm (r = 0.8, NRMSE of 25.06%) and near-infrared (NIR) 865 nm (r = 0.98, NRMSE of 10.28%) parts of the spectrum, showing the MSI sensor's great potential to estimate TSS even though it was not designed for aquatic remote sensing."
383,137-6,The first year of data reveals improved monitoring along the coastal region at unprecedented resolution with accuracy to detect the Estuarine Turbidity Maximum (ETM).
384,137-7,ACOLITE and POLYMER Atmospheric Correction strategies are applied over this coastal region (no in-situ data on water reflectance).
385,137-8,The results confirm that the flexible POLYMER algorithm can address intense sun-glint effects.
386,137-9,"These findings encourage further research of water quality studies relying on both operational Sentinel-2A and Sentinel-2B, with great implications to improve the understanding of turbid coastal and inland water environments."
387,138-1,"Fogo volcano erupted in 2014-2015 producing an extensive lava flow field in the summit caldera that destroyed two villages, Portela and Bangaeira."
388,138-2,"The eruption started with powerful explosive activity, lava fountains, and a substantial ash column accompanying the opening of an eruptive fissure."
389,138-3,Lava flows spreading from the base of the eruptive fissure produced three arterial lava flows.
390,138-4,"By a week after the start of the eruption, a master lava tube had already developed within the eruptive fissure and along the arterial flow."
391,138-5,"In this paper, we analyze the emplacement processes based on observations carried out directly on the lava flow field, remote sensing measurements carried out with a thermal camera, SO2 fluxes, and satellite images, to unravel the key factors leading to the development of lava tubes."
392,138-6,"These were responsible for the rapid expansion of lava for the -7.9 km length of the flow field, as well as the destruction of the Portela and Bangaeira villages."
393,138-7,The key factors leading to the development of tubes were the low topography and the steady magma supply rate along the arterial lava flow.
394,138-8,"Comparing time-averaged discharge rates (TADR) obtained from satellite and Supply Rate (SR) derived from SO2 flux data, we estimate the amount and timing of the lava flow field endogenous growth, with the aim of developing a tool that could be used for hazard assessment and risk mitigation at this and other volcanoes."
395,139-1,The k(d)(490) is a vertical light attenuation coefficient and an important parameter for water quality.
396,139-2,"The k(d) estimates are often based on empirical and semi-analytical algorithms, designed for oceanic and coastal waters."
397,139-3,"However, there is a lack of information about the performances of these models to inland waters dominated by chromophoric dissolved organic matter (CDOM)."
398,139-4,"Therefore, to contribute to this investigation, nine empirical models based on the blue-to-green and blue-to-red ratios and chlorophyll-a (Chl-a) concentration were evaluated, as well as three semi-analytical models using bands from the Operational Land Imager (OLI)/Landsat-8."
399,139-5,"The errors (mean absolute percentage error, MAPE > 80%) presented by the empirical models confirmed that the blue-to-green ratio failed in retrieving k(d)(490) in an environment dominated by CDOM."
400,139-6,Similar failures occurred with the models using the Chl-a concentration (MAPE similar to 60%) as input.
401,139-7,A semi-analytical approach showed the lowest error (MAPE = 41.04%) in the estimate of the inherent optical properties for complex waters in order to reduce the errors above.
402,139-8,"After retrieval of k(d)(490) using the semi-analytical model, seasonal patterns were observed, and high values of k(d)(490) were detected in the dry season possibly due to the increase of the concentration of the optically-significant substances (OSS)."
403,14-1,Artificial light at night (ALAN) provides a unique footprint of human activities and settlements.
404,14-2,"However, the adverse effects of ALAN on human health and ecosystems have not been well understood."
405,14-3,"Because of a lack of high resolution data, studies of ALAN in China have been confined to coarse resolution, and fine-scale details are missing."
406,14-4,"The fine details of ALAN are pertinent, because the highly dense population in Chinese cities has created a distinctive urban lighting pattern."
407,14-5,"In this paper, we introduced a new generation of high spatial resolution and multi-spectral night-time light imagery from the satellite JL1-3B."
408,14-6,"We examined its effectiveness for monitoring the spatial pattern and discriminating the types of artificial light based on a case study of Hangzhou, China."
409,14-7,"Specifically, local Moran's I analysis was applied to identify artificial light hotspots."
410,14-8,"Then, we analyzed the relationship between artificial light brightness and land uses at the parcel-level, which were generated from GF-2 imagery and open social datasets."
411,14-9,"Third, a machine learning based method was proposed to discriminate the type of lighting sources - between high pressure sodium lamps (HPS) and light-emitting diode lamps (LED) - by incorporating their spectral information and morphology feature."
412,14-10,"The result shows a complicated heterogeneity of illumination characteristics across different land uses, where main roads, commercial and institutional areas were brightly lit while residential area, industrial area and agricultural land were dark at night."
413,14-11,"It further shows that the proposed method was effective at separating light emitted by HPS and LED, with an overall accuracy and kappa coefficient of 83.86% and 0.67, respectively."
414,14-12,"This study demonstrates the effectiveness of JL1-3B and its superiority over previous night-time light data in detecting details of lighting objects and the nightscape pattern, and suggests that JL1-3B and alike could open up new opportunities for the advancement of night-time remote sensing."
415,140-1,Quantitative Precipitation Estimates (QPEs) obtained from remote sensing or ground-based radars could complement or even be an alternative to rain gauge readings.
416,140-2,"However, to be used in operational applications, a validation process has to be carried out, usually by comparing their estimates with those of a rain gauges network."
417,140-3,"In this paper, the accuracy of three QPEs are evaluated for three extreme precipitation events in the last decade in the southeast of the Iberian Peninsula."
418,140-4,"The first QPE is PERSIANN-CCS (Precipitation Estimation from Remotely Sensed Information using Artificial Neural Networks - Cloud Classification System) , a satellite-based QPE."
419,140-5,The second and the third are QPEs from a meteorological radar with Doppler capabilities that works in the C band.
420,140-6,Pixel-to-point comparisons are made between the values offered by the QPEs and those obtained by two networks of rain gauges.
421,140-7,The results obtained indicate that all the QPEs were well below the rain gauge values in extreme rainfall time slots.
422,140-8,There seems to be a weak linear association between the value of the discrepancies and the precipitation value of the QPEs.
423,140-9,"The main conclusion, assuming the information from the rain gauges as ground truth, is that neither PERSIANN-CCS nor radar, without empirical calibration, are acceptable QPEs for the real-time monitoring of meteorological extremes in the southeast of the Iberian Peninsula."
424,141-1,Matching multi-sensor remote sensing images is still a challenging task due to textural changes and non-linear intensity differences.
425,141-2,"In this paper, a novel matching method is proposed for multi-sensor remote sensing images."
426,141-3,"To establish feature correspondences, an affinity tensor is used to integrate geometric and radiometric information."
427,141-4,The matching process consists of three steps.
428,141-5,"First, features from an accelerated segment test are extracted from both source and target images, and two complete graphs are constructed with their nodes representing these features."
429,141-6,"Then, the geometric and radiometric similarities of the feature points are represented by the three-order affinity tensor, and the initial feature correspondences are established by tensor power iteration."
430,141-7,"Finally, a tensor-based mismatch detection process is conducted to purify the initial matched points."
431,141-8,"The robustness and capability of the proposed method are tested with a variety of remote sensing images such as Ziyuan-3 backward, Ziyuan-3 nadir, Gaofen-1, Gaofen-2, unmanned aerial vehicle platform, and Jilin-1."
432,141-9,"The experiments show that the average matching recall is greater than 0.5, which outperforms state-of-the-art multi-sensor image-matching algorithms such as SIFT, SURF, NG-SIFT, OR-SIFT and GOM-SIFT."
433,142-1,Airborne LiDAR (Light Detection And Ranging) remote sensing for individual tree-level forest inventory necessitates proper extraction of individual trees and accurate measurement of tree structural parameters.
434,142-2,"Due to the inadequate tree finding capability offered by LiDAR technology and the complex patterns of forest canopies, significant omission and commission errors occur frequently in the segmentation results."
435,142-3,"Aimed at error reduction and accuracy refinement, this paper presents a novel adaptive mean shift-based clustering scheme aided by a tree trunk detection technique to segment individual trees and estimate tree structural parameters based solely on the airborne LiDAR data."
436,142-4,Tree trunks are detected by analyzing points' vertical histogram to detach all potential crown points and then clustering the separated trunk points according to their horizontal mutual distances.
437,142-5,The detected trunk information is used to adaptively calibrate the kernel bandwidth of the mean shift procedure in the fine segmentation stage by applying an original 2D (two-dimensional) estimation of individual crown diameters.
438,142-6,Trunk detection results and LiDAR point clusters generated by the adaptive mean shift procedures serve as mutual references for final detection of individual trees.
439,142-7,Experimental results show that a combination of adaptive mean shift clustering and detected tree trunk can provide a significant performance improvement in individual tree-level forest measurement.
440,142-8,"Compared with conventional clustering techniques, the trunk detection-aided mean shift clustering approach can detect 91.1% of the trees (""recall"") with a higher tree positioning accuracy (the mean positioning error is reduced by 33%) in a multi-layered coniferous and broad-leaved mixed forest in South China, and 93.5% of the identified trees are correct (""precision"")."
441,142-9,"The tree detection brings the estimation of structural parameters for individual trees up to an accuracy level: -2.2% mean relative error and 5.8% relative RMSE (Root Mean Square Error) for tree height and 0.6% mean relative error and 21.9% relative RMSE for crown diameter, respectively."
442,143-1,Spatiotemporal fusion of remote sensing data is essential for generating high spatial and temporal resolution data by taking advantage of high spatial resolution and high temporal resolution imageries.
443,143-2,"At present, the Spatial and Temporal Adaptive Reflectance Fusion Model (STARFM) is one of the most widely used spatiotemporal fusion technologies of remote sensing data."
444,143-3,"However, the quality of data acquired by STARFM depends on temporal information from homogeneous land cover patches at the MODIS (Moderate Resolution Imaging Spectroradiometer) imagery, and the estimation accuracy of STARFM degrades in highly fragmentated and heterogeneous patches."
445,143-4,"To address this problem, we developed an innovative method to improve fusion accuracy, especially in areas of high heterogeneity, by combining linear pixel unmixing and STARFM."
446,143-5,This method derived the input data of STARFM by downscaling the MODIS data with a linear spectral mixture model.
447,143-6,"Through this fusion method, the complement effect of the advantages of remote sensing information can be realized, and the multi-source remote sensing data can be realized for visual data mining."
448,143-7,"The developed fusion method was applied in Bosten Lake, the largest freshwater lake in China, and our analysis of results suggests that (1) after introducing the linear spectral mixture model, the fusion images illustrated improved spatial details to a certain extent and can be employed to identify small objects, as well as their texture distribution information; (2) for fragmented and highly heterogeneous areas, a stronger correlation between the predicted results and the real images was observed when compared to STARFM with small bias; and (3) the predicted red band and near infrared band can generate high-precision 16-m NDVI (Normalized Difference Vegetation Index) data with advantages in both spatial resolution and temporal resolution."
449,143-8,The results are generally consistent with the Gaofen-1 wide field of view cameras (GF-1 WFV) NDVI in the same period and therefore can reflect the spatial distribution of NDVI in detail.
450,144-1,The French/Indian altimeter project Satellite with ARGOS and AltiKa (SARAL) completed its nominal 3-year mission on the historical European Remote-sensing Satellite (ERS) orbit in Spring 2016.
451,144-2,"In order to extend the lifetime of the satellite as much as possible, the agencies in charge of SARAL decided to initiate a so-called drifting phase where the satellite altitude is no longer maintained."
452,144-3,In this paper we describe how the ocean mesoscale sampling capability of SARAL has been preserved during the drifting phase by initiating it at a specific altitude: the optimal starting point was approximately 1 km above the historical ERS/ENVIronment SATellite (ENVISAT) orbit.
453,144-4,This strategy secured the ocean mesoscale sampling capability of SARAL drifting phase (DP) for 6 years or more.
454,144-5,We also generalize these findings: any altimeter could follow SARAL's drifting phase strategy if their maneuvering capability is limited.
455,144-6,"Lastly, we explain how an altimetry mission or an entire altimeter constellation could be operated without any form of altitude control: some specific altitude bands (e.g., near 1230 km) guarantee a high-quality mesoscale sampling for years or decades even if the altitude is not maintained."
456,145-1,"A flow duration curve (FDC) provides a comprehensive description of the hydrological regime of a catchment and its knowledge is fundamental for many water-related applications (e.g., water management and supply, human and irrigation purposes, etc.)."
457,145-2,"However, relying on historical streamflow records, FDCs are constrained to gauged stations and, thus, typically available for a small portion of the world's rivers."
458,145-3,"The upcoming Surface Water and Ocean Topography satellite (SWOT; in orbit from 2021) will monitor, worldwide, all rivers larger than 100 m in width (with a goal to observe rivers as small as 50 m) for a period of at least three years, representing a potential groundbreaking source of hydrological data, especially in remote areas."
459,145-4,This study refers to the 130 km stretch of the Po River (Northern Italy) to investigate SWOT potential in providing discharge estimation for the construction of FDCs.
460,145-5,"In particular, this work considers the mission lifetime (three years) and the three satellite orbits (i.e., 211, 489, 560) that will monitor the Po River."
461,145-6,"The aim is to test the ability to observe the river hydrological regime, which is, for this test case, synthetically reproduced by means of a quasi-2D hydraulic model."
462,145-7,We consider different river segmentation lengths for discharge estimation and we build the FDCs at four gauging stations placed along the study area referring to available satellite overpasses (nearly 52 revisits within the mission lifetime).
463,145-8,"Discharge assessment is performed using the Manning equation, under the assumption of a trapezoidal section, known bathymetry, and roughness coefficient."
464,145-9,"SWOT observables (i.e., water level, water extent, etc.) are estimated by corrupting the values simulated with the quasi-2D model according to the mission requirements."
465,145-10,"Remotely-sensed FDCs are compared with those obtained with extended (e.g., 20-70 years) gauge datasets."
466,145-11,Results highlight the potential of the mission to provide a realistic reconstruction of the flow regimes at different locations.
467,145-12,"Higher errors are obtained at the FDC tails, where very low or high flows have lower likelihood of being observed, or might not occur during the mission lifetime period."
468,145-13,"Among the tested discretizations, 20 km stretches provided the best performances, with root mean absolute errors, on average, lower than 13.3%."
469,146-1,"Lake Tana is the largest lake in Ethiopia, and its lake outflow is the source of the Blue Nile River that provides vital water resources for many livelihoods and downstream/international stakeholders."
470,146-2,"Therefore, it is essential to quantify and monitor the water balance of Lake Tana."
471,146-3,"However, Lake Tana is poorly gauged, with more than 50% of Lake Tana Basin being ungauged from in-situ measurements, making it difficult to quantify the lake inflow from surrounding basins."
472,146-4,The lack of in-situ measurements highlights the need for the innovative application of satellite remote sensing.
473,146-5,This study explores how freely accessible satellite remote sensing can be used to complement routine weather data to quantify the water balance of Lake Tana and its surrounding catchments.
474,146-6,This study particularly investigates whether the outflow from Lake Tana can be estimated with sufficient accuracy as the residual of the lake water balance.
475,146-7,"Monthly inflow into lake was computed as the total runoff from the surrounding catchments; the runoff was estimated as the residual of the land-based catchment water balance using satellite precipitation improved with an integrated downscaling-calibration procedure, satellite evapotranspiration, and a correction term for changes in land total storage (soil moisture storage and deep percolation)."
476,146-8,"The outflow from Lake Tana was estimated as the residual of lake water balance by combining satellite-based lake precipitation, changes in water storage, and lake inflow with estimated lake evaporation."
477,146-9,"Evaluation using limited available measurements showed that estimated annual runoff for two gauged subbasins agreed well with measurements, with differences within 4%."
478,146-10,"The estimated annual outflow from Lake Tana was also close to measured outflow, with a difference of 12%."
479,146-11,"However, the estimated monthly runoff from catchments and monthly lake outflow were unsatisfactory, with large errors."
480,147-1,Microwave radar is a well-established tool for all-weather monitoring of film slicks which appear in radar imagery of the surface of water bodies as areas of reduced backscatter due to suppression of short wind waves.
481,147-2,"Information about slicks obtained with single-band/one-polarized radar seems to be insufficient for film characterization; hence, new capabilities of multi-polarization radars for monitoring of film slicks have been actively discussed in the literature."
482,147-3,In this paper the results of new experiments on remote sensing of film slicks using dual co-polarized radarsa satellite TerraSAR-X and a ship-based X-/C-/S-band radarare presented.
483,147-4,"Radar backscattering is assumed to contain Bragg and non-Bragg components (BC and NBC, respectively)."
484,147-5,"BC is due to backscattering from resonant cm-scale wind waves, while NBC is supposed to be associated with wave breaking."
485,147-6,"Each of the components can be eliminated from the total radar backscatter measured at two co-polarizations, and contrasts of Bragg and non-Bragg components in slicks can be analyzed separately."
486,147-7,New data on a damping ratio (contrast) characterizing reduction of radar returns in slicks are obtained for the two components of radar backscatter in various radar bands.
487,147-8,The contrast values for Bragg and non-Bragg components are comparable to each other and demonstrate similar dependence on radar wave number; BC and NBC contrasts grow monotonically for the cases of upwind and downwind observations and weakly decrease with wave number for the cross-wind direction.
488,147-9,Reduction of BC in slicks can be explained by enhanced viscous damping of cm-scale Bragg waves due to an elastic film.
489,147-10,Physical mechanisms of NBC reduction in slicks are discussed.
490,147-11,"It is hypothesized that strong breaking (e.g., white-capping) weakly contributes to the NBC contrast because of cleaning of the water surface due to turbulent surfactant mixing associated with wave crest overturning."
491,147-12,"An effective mechanism of NBC reduction due to film can be associated with modification of micro-breaking wave features, such as parasitic ripples, bulge, and toe, in slicks."
492,148-1,The correction of directional effects on satellite-retrieved land surface temperature (LST) is of high relevance for a proper interpretation of spatial and temporal features contained in LST fields.
493,148-2,This study presents a methodology to correct such directional effects in an operational setting.
494,148-3,"This methodology relies on parametric models, which are computationally efficient and require few input information, making them particularly appropriate for operational use."
495,148-4,"The models are calibrated with LST data collocated in time and space from MODIS (Aqua and Terra) and SEVIRI (Meteosat), for an area covering the entire SEVIRI disk and encompassing the full year of 2011."
496,148-5,"Past studies showed that such models are prone to overfitting, especially when there are discrepancies between the LSTs that are not related to the viewing geometry (e.g., emissivity, atmospheric correction)."
497,148-6,"To reduce such effects, pixels with similar characteristics are first grouped by means of a cluster analysis."
498,148-7,The models' calibration is then performed on each one of the selected clusters.
499,148-8,The derived coefficients reflect the expected impact of vegetation and topography on the anisotropy of LST.
500,148-9,"Furthermore, when tested with independent data, the calibrated models are shown to maintain the capability of representing the angular dependency of the differences between LST derived from polar-orbiter (MODIS) and geostationary (Meteosat, GOES and Himawari) satellites."
501,148-10,"The methodology presented here is currently being used to estimate the deviation of LST products with respect to what would be obtained for a reference view angle (e.g., nadir), therefore contributing to the harmonization of LST products."
502,149-1,The Eastern Lagoon of New Caledonia (ELNC) is a semi-enclosed system surrounded by an extensive coral reef barrier.
503,149-2,"The system has been suffering impacts from climate variability and anthropogenic activities, including mining exploitation."
504,149-3,Satellite monitoring is thus an essential tool to detect such changes.
505,149-4,"The present study aimed to assess the bio-optical variability of the ELNC and examine the applicability of ocean colour algorithms, using in situ bio-optical and radiometric data, collected during the March 2014 CALIOPE 2 cruise."
506,149-5,"The chlorophyll a concentration (Chla) varied from 0.13-0.72 mg.m(-3), and the coastal stations were spectrally dominated by non-algal particles (NAP) and coloured dissolved organic matter (CDOM) (>80% of the total non-water absorption at 443 nm), due to the contribution of allochthonous sources."
507,149-6,"The phytoplankton specific absorption was generally lower (mean, 0.049 m(2).mg Chla(-1)) than typical values observed for the corresponding Chla range, as well as the spectral slopes of the absorption of CDOM plus NAP (a(dg)) (mean, 0.016 nm(-1)) and of the particle backscattering coefficient (b(bp)) (mean, 0.07 nm(-1))."
508,149-7,The remote sensing reflectance obtained using two in-water approaches and modelled from Inherent Optical Properties (IOPs) showed less than 20% relative percent differences (RPD).
509,149-8,"Chla estimates were highly biased for the empirical (OC4 and OC3) and semi-analytical (GSM, QAA, GIOP, LMI) algorithms, especially at the coastal stations."
510,149-9,"Excluding these stations, the GSM01 yielded the best retrievals with 35-40% RPD. a(dg)(443) was well retrieved by all algorithms with similar to 18% RPD, and b(bp)(443) with similar to 40% RPD."
511,149-10,"Turbidity algorithms also performed reasonably well (30% RPD), showing the capacity and usefulness of the derived products to monitor the water quality of the ELNC, provided accurate atmospheric correction of the satellite data."
512,149-11,"Regionally tuned algorithms may potentially improve the Chla retrievals, but better parameterization schemes that consider the spatiotemporal variability of the specific IOPs are still needed."
513,15-1,Multiangle remote sensing plays a central role in the development of algorithms for the retrieval of various surface biophysical parameters that are influenced by the reflectance anisotropy.
514,15-2,Surface reflectance anisotropy is characterized by the Bidirectional Reflectance Distribution Function (BRDF).
515,15-3,"Within the past decade, spaceborne multiangle observations acquired by the MODerate resolution Imaging Spectroradiometer (MODIS) sensor (which has a gridded spatial resolution of 500 m) and by the POLarization and Directionality of Earth Reflectances (POLDER) sensor (which has a spatial resolution of 6 x 7 km) have been used for a wide variety of global applications."
516,15-4,"However, it is necessary to fully understand the variability inherent in the surface BRDF information as retrieved from MODIS and POLDER at these two spatial resolutions to optimize their use."
517,15-5,"In this study, we make use of extensive POLDER Bidirectional Reflectance Factors (BRFs) selected from the entire archive of the POLDER BRDF database and standard MODIS BRDF parameter products (MCD43A1, Collection V005) that were geolocated within the same spatial extents as the POLDER data."
518,15-6,The variability in surface BRDF is characterized by investigation of three BRDF model parameters as retrieved from MODIS and POLDER and a comprehensive index indicating the variations in the primary dome-bowl BRDF patterns (the anisotropic flat index (AFX)).
519,15-7,The principal information content contained in these BRDF data is characterized by the general BRDF shapes (the BRDF archetypes) that account for > 90% of the total variance in these BRDF data.
520,15-8,A hotspotrevised BRDF model is used directly on top of the retrieved model BRDF parameters to capture the hotspot effect associated with these BRDF parameters.
521,15-9,"The main findings of this study show that the variability in surface BRDF, as extracted from the MODIS and POLDER datasets, shares six reciprocal BRDF archetypes."
522,15-10,"However, the 500-m MODIS BRDF data can uniquely capture some additional extreme BRDF shapes mainly due to the data's finer pixel scales."
523,15-11,"These original findings are very important, because subsequent albedo retrievals can be significantly impacted by the use of BRDFs of different resolutions."
524,15-12,This study provides evidence concerning the influence of spatial resolution on angular variation patterns of optical reflectance as retrieved from the MODIS and POLDER BRDF products.
525,150-1,"In the process of object-based change detection (OBCD), scale is a significant factor related to extraction and analyses of subsequent change data."
526,150-2,"To address this problem, this paper describes an object-based approach to urban area change detection (CD) using rotation forest (RoF) and coarse-to-fine uncertainty analyses of multi-temporal high-resolution remote sensing images."
527,150-3,"First, highly homogeneous objects with consistent spatial positions are identified through vector-raster integration and multi-scale fine segmentation."
528,150-4,"The multi-temporal images are stacked and segmented under the constraints of a historical land use vector map using a series of optimal segmentation scales, ranging from coarse to fine."
529,150-5,"Second, neighborhood correlation image analyses are performed to highlight pixels with high probabilities of being changed or unchanged, which can be used as a prerequisite for object-based analyses."
530,150-6,"Third, based on the coarse-to-fine segmentation and pixel-based pre-classification results, change possibilities are calculated for various objects."
531,150-7,"Furthermore, changed and unchanged objects identified at different scales are automatically selected to serve as training samples."
532,150-8,The spectral and texture features of each object are extracted.
533,150-9,"Finally, uncertain objects are classified using the RoF classifier."
534,150-10,Multi-scale classification results are combined using a majority voting rule to generate the final CD results.
535,150-11,"In experiments using two pairs of real high-resolution remote sensing datasets, our proposed approach outperformed existing methods in terms of CD accuracy, verifying its feasibility and effectiveness."
536,151-1,"The Landsat archives have been made freely available in 2008, allowing the production of high resolution built-up maps at the regional or global scale."
537,151-2,"In this context, most of the classification algorithms rely on supervised learning to tackle the heterogeneity of the urban environments."
538,151-3,"However, at a large scale, the process of collecting training samples becomes a huge project in itself."
539,151-4,This leads to a growing interest from the remote sensing community toward Volunteered Geographic Information (VGI) projects such as OpenStreetMap (OSM).
540,151-5,"Despite the spatial heterogeneity of its contribution patterns, OSM provides an increasing amount of information on the earth's surface."
541,151-6,"More interestingly, the community has moved beyond street mapping to collect a wider range of spatial data such as building footprints, land use, or points of interest."
542,151-7,"In this paper, we propose a classification method that makes use of OSM to automatically collect training samples for supervised learning of built-up areas."
543,151-8,"To take into account a wide range of potential issues, the approach is assessed in ten Sub-Saharan African urban areas from various demographic profiles and climates."
544,151-9,The obtained results are compared with: (1) existing high resolution global urban maps such as the Global Human Settlement Layer (GHSL) or the Human Built-up and Settlements Extent (HBASE); and (2) a supervised classification based on manually digitized training samples.
545,151-10,"The results suggest that automated supervised classifications based on OSM can provide performances similar to manual approaches, provided that OSM training samples are sufficiently available and correctly pre-processed."
546,151-11,"Moreover, the proposed method could reach better results in the near future, given the increasing amount and variety of information in the OSM database."
547,152-1,"High-resolution airborne thermal infrared (TIR) together with sun-induced fluorescence (SIF) and hyperspectral optical images (visible, near- and shortwave infrared; VNIR/SWIR) were jointly acquired over an experimental site."
548,152-2,The objective of this study was to evaluate the potential of these state-of-the-art remote sensing techniques for detecting symptoms similar to those occurring during water stress (hereinafter referred to as water stress symptoms') at airborne level.
549,152-3,"Flights with two camera systems (Telops Hyper-Cam LW, Specim HyPlant) took place during 11th and 12th June 2014 in Latisana, Italy over a commercial grass (Festuca arundinacea and Poa pratense) farm with plots that were treated with an anti-transpirant agent (Vapor Gard (R); VG) and a highly reflective powder (kaolin; KA)."
550,152-4,"Both agents affect energy balance of the vegetation by reducing transpiration and thus reducing latent heat dissipation (VG) and by increasing albedo, i.e., decreasing energy absorption (KA)."
551,152-5,"Concurrent in situ meteorological data from an on-site weather station, surface temperature and chamber flux measurements were obtained."
552,152-6,"Image data were processed to orthorectified maps of TIR indices (surface temperature (T-s), Crop Water Stress Index (CWSI)), SIF indices (F-687, F-780) and VNIR/SWIR indices (photochemical reflectance index (PRI), normalised difference vegetation index (NDVI), moisture stress index (MSI), etc.)."
553,152-7,A linear mixed effects model that respects the nested structure of the experimental setup was employed to analyse treatment effects on the remote sensing parameters.
554,152-8,Airborne T-s were in good agreement (Delta T < 0.35 K) compared to in situ T-s measurements.
555,152-9,"Maps and boxplots of TIR-based indices show diurnal changes: T-s was lowest in the early morning, increased by 6 K up to late morning as a consequence of increasing net radiation and air temperature (T-air) and remained stable towards noon due to the compensatory cooling effect of increased plant transpiration; this was also confirmed by the chamber measurements."
556,152-10,"In the early morning, VG treated plots revealed significantly higher T-s compared to control (CR) plots (p = 0.01), while SIF indices showed no significant difference (p = 1.00) at any of the overpasses."
557,152-11,"A comparative assessment of the spectral domains regarding their capabilities for water stress detection was limited due to: (i) synchronously overpasses of the two airborne sensors were not feasible, and (ii) instead of a real water stress occurrence only water stress symptoms were simulated by the chemical agents."
558,152-12,"Nevertheless, the results of the study show that the polymer di-1-p-menthene had an anti-transpiring effect on the plant while photosynthetic efficiency of light reactions remained unaffected."
559,152-13,"VNIR/SWIR indices as well as SIF indices were highly sensitive to KA, because of an overall increase in spectral reflectance and thus a reduced absorbed energy."
560,152-14,"On the contrary, the TIR domain was highly sensitive to subtle changes in the temperature regime as induced by VG and KA, whereas VNIR/SWIR and SIF domain were less affected by VG treatment."
561,152-15,"The benefit of a multi-sensor approach is not only to provide useful information about actual plant status but also on the causes of biophysical, physiological and photochemical changes."
562,153-1,We used unmanned aerial vehicles (UAVs) to carry out a relatively complete population census of large wild herbivores in Maduo County on the Tibetan Plateau in the spring of 2017.
563,153-2,"The effective area covered by aerial surveys was 326.6 km(2), and 23,784 images were acquired."
564,153-3,"Interpretation tag libraries for UAV images were created for wild animals, including Kiang (Equus kiang), Tibetan gazelle (Procapra picticaudata), and blue sheep (Pseudois nayaur), as well as livestock, including yaks and Tibetan sheep."
565,153-4,Large wild herbivores in the survey transect were identified through manual imagery interpretation.
566,153-5,"Densities ranged from 1.15/km(2) for Kiang, 0.61/km(2) for Tibetan gazelle, 0.62/km(2) for blue sheep, 4.12/km(2) for domestic yak, and 7.34/km(2) for domestic sheep."
567,153-6,"A method based on meadows in the cold and warm seasons was used for estimating the densities and numbers of large wild herbivores and livestock, and was verified against records of livestock numbers."
568,153-7,"Population estimates for Kiang, Tibetan gazelle, blue sheep, domestic yak, and domestic sheep were 17,109, 15,961, 9324, 70,846, and 102,194, respectively."
569,153-8,"Based on published consumption estimates, the results suggest that domestic stock consume 4.5 times the amount of vegetation of large wild herbivores."
570,153-9,"Compared with traditional ground survey methods, performance of UAV remote sensing surveys of large wild herbivore populations was fast, economical and reliable, providing an effective future method for surveying wild animals."
571,154-1,"Since over 70% of carbon emissions are from urban areas, it is of great importance to develop an effective measurement technique that can accurately monitor atmospheric CO2 in global urban areas."
572,154-2,Remote sensing could be an effective way to achieve this goal.
573,154-3,"However, due to high aerosol loading in urban areas, there are large, inadequately resolved areas in the CO2 products acquired by passive remote sensing."
574,154-4,China is planning to launch the Atmospheric Environment Monitoring Satellite (AEMS) equipped with a CO2-light detecting and ranging (LIDAR) system.
575,154-5,This work conducted a feasibility study on obtaining city-scale column CO2 volume mixing ratios (XCO2) using the LIDAR measurements.
576,154-6,"A performance framework consisting of a sensor model, sampling model, and environmental model was proposed to fulfill our demand."
577,154-7,We found that both the coverage and the accuracy of the LIDAR-derived city-scale XCO2 values were highly dependent on the orbit height.
578,154-8,"With an orbit height of 450 km, random errors of less than 0.3% are expected for all four metropolitan areas tested in this work."
579,154-9,"However, random errors of less than 0.3% were obtained in only two metropolitan areas with an orbit height of 705 km."
580,154-10,Our simulations also showed that off-nadir sampling would improve the performance of a CO2-Integrated Path Differential Absorption (IPDA) LIDAR system operating in a 705 km orbit.
581,154-11,These results indicate that an active remote sensing mission could help to effectively measure XCO2 values in urban areas.
582,154-12,More detailed studies are needed to reveal the potential of such equipment for improving the verification of carbon emissions and the estimation of urban carbon fluxes.
583,155-1,"The U.S. Environmental Protection Agency banned the use of polychlorinated biphenyls (PCBs) in 1979, due to the high environmental and public health risks with which they are associated."
584,155-2,"However, PCBs continue to persist in the San Francisco Bay (SFB), often at concentrations deemed unsafe for humans."
585,155-3,"In situ PCB monitoring within the SFB is extremely limited, due in large part to the high monetary costs associated with sampling."
586,155-4,Here we offer a cost effective alternative to in situ PCB monitoring by demonstrating the feasibility of indirectly quantifying PCBs in the SFB via satellite remote sensing using a two-step approach.
587,155-5,"First, we determined the relationship between in situ PCB concentrations and suspended sediment concentrations (SSC) in the SFB."
588,155-6,We then correlated in situ SSC with spatially and temporally consistent Landsat 8 and Sentinel 2A reflectances.
589,155-7,"We demonstrate strong relationships between SSC and PCBs in all three SFB sub-embayments (R-2 > 0.28-0.80, p < 0.01), as well as a robust relationship between SSC and satellite measurements for both Landsat 8 and Sentinel 2A (R-2 > 0.72, p < 0.01)."
590,155-8,These relationships held regardless of the atmospheric correction regime that we applied.
591,155-9,The end product of these relationships is an empirical two-step relationship capable of deriving PCBs from satellite imagery.
592,155-10,Our approach of estimating PCBs in the SFB by remotely sensing SSC is extremely cost-effective when compared to traditional in situ techniques.
593,155-11,"Moreover, it can also be utilized to generate PCB concentration maps for the SFB."
594,155-12,"These maps could one day serve as an important tool for PCB remediation in the SFB, as they can provide valuable insight into the spatial distribution of PCBs throughout the bay, as well as how this distribution changes over time."
595,156-1,Active learning (AL) has been shown to be very effective in hyperspectral image (HSI) classification.
596,156-2,It significantly improves the performance by selecting a small quantity of the most informative training samples to reduce the complexity of classification.
597,156-3,Multiview AL (MVAL) can make the comprehensive analysis of both object characterization and sampling selection in AL by using various features of multiple views.
598,156-4,"However, the original MVAL cannot effectively exploit the spectral-spatial information by respecting the three-dimensional (3D) nature of the HSI and the query selection strategy in the MVAL is only based on the disagreement of multiple views."
599,156-5,"In this paper, we propose a 3D-Gabor inspired MVAL method for spectral-spatial HSI classification, which consists of two main steps."
600,156-6,"First, in the view generation step, we adopt a 3D-Gabor filter to generate multiple cubes with limited bands and utilize the feature assessment strategies to select cubes for constructing views."
601,156-7,"Second, in the sampling selection step, a novel method is proposed by using both internal and external uncertainty estimation (IEUE) of views."
602,156-8,"Specifically, we use the distributions of posterior probability to learn the internal uncertainty of each independent view, and adopt the inconsistencies between views to estimate the external uncertainty."
603,156-9,"Classification accuracies of the proposed method for the four benchmark HSI datasets can be as high as 99.57%, 99.93%, 99.02%, 98.82%, respectively, demonstrating the improved performance as compared with other state-of-the-art methods."
604,157-1,"3D building models are an essential data infrastructure for various applications in a smart city system, since they facilitate spatial queries, spatial analysis, and interactive visualization."
605,157-2,"Due to the highly complex nature of building structures, automatically reconstructing 3D buildings from point clouds remains a challenging task."
606,157-3,"In this paper, a Roof Attribute Graph (RAG) method is proposed to describe the decomposition and topological relations within a complicated roof structure."
607,157-4,"Furthermore, top-down decomposition and bottom-up refinement processes are proposed to reconstruct roof parts according to the Gestalt laws, generating a complete structural model with a hierarchical topological tree."
608,157-5,Two LiDAR datasets from Guangdong (China) and Vaihingen (Germany) with different point densities were used in our study.
609,157-6,"Experimental results, including the assessment on Vaihingen standardized by the International Society for Photogrammetry and Remote Sensing (ISPRS), show that the proposed method can be used to model 3D building roofs with high quality results as demonstrated by the completeness and correctness metrics presented in this paper."
610,158-1,Rangelands are critical working landscapes and are the focus of considerable conservation planning efforts globally.
611,158-2,A key conservation challenge in these landscapes is that high interannual variability in both climatic conditions and land use greatly limits the utility of outdated or static vegetation maps for management decision-making.
612,158-3,"One potential solution to this problem lies in remote sensing-derived information; however, prospective users must have continuous and timely access to vegetation products tailored to their needs."
613,158-4,"Google Earth Engine (GEE) can overcome the many storage, processing, and visualization barriers associated with creating ready-to-use remote sensing products for the public."
614,158-5,"While GEE provides a platform for building tools to analyze data and share results with users in near real-time for adaptive management, monitoring products need to (1) provide accurate and stable estimates over time and (2) align with management goals and the ecology of the rangeland system in question."
615,158-6,"Here, we assess estimates of vegetation cover and above-ground biomass at two dominant phenological time periods (summer/green and fall/brown), as modeled from the Landsat 7 and Landsat 8 Climatic Data Record (CDR) product."
616,158-7,"Using a best-subset regression modeling approach, we modeled vegetation cover and biomass, finding that the best predictors vary by season, corresponding to vegetation phenology."
617,158-8,We also found that sensor-specific models decreased the relative differences between mapped cover and biomass estimates when comparing Landsat 7 and Landsat 8 scenes one day apart in the summer and fall.
618,158-9,"Ultimately, we developed an automated model selection process driven by sensor and vegetation greenness that can run in GEE to monitor and analyze vegetation amounts across the grazing season for adaptive management."
619,159-1,Himalayan glacier changes in the context of global climate change have attracted worldwide attention due to their profound cryo-hydrological ramifications.
620,159-2,"However, an integrated understanding of the debris-free and debris-covered glacier evolution and its interaction with glacial lake is still lacking."
621,159-3,"Using one case study in the Gyirong River Basin located in the central Himalayas, this paper applied archival Landsat imagery and an automated mapping method to understand how glaciers and glacial lakes interactively evolved between 1988 and 2015."
622,159-4,"Our analyses identified 467 glaciers in 1988, containing 435 debris-free and 32 debris-covered glaciers, with a total area of 614.09 +/- 36.69 km(2)."
623,159-5,"These glaciers decreased by 16.45% in area from 1988 to 2015, with an accelerated retreat rate after 1994."
624,159-6,Debris-free glaciers retreated faster than debris-covered glaciers.
625,159-7,"As a result of glacial downwasting, supraglacial debris coverage expanded upward by 17.79 km2 (24.44%)."
626,159-8,"Concurrent with glacial retreat, glacial lakes increased in both number (+41) and area (+54.11%)."
627,159-9,Glacier-connected lakes likely accelerated the glacial retreat via thermal energy transmission and contributed to over 15% of the area loss in their connected glaciers.
628,159-10,"On the other hand, significant glacial retreats led to disconnections from their proglacial lakes, which appeared to stabilize the lake areas."
629,159-11,"Continuous expansions in the lakes connected with debris-covered glaciers, therefore, need additional attention due to their potential outbursts."
630,159-12,"In comparison with precipitation variation, temperature increase was the primary driver of such glacier and glacial lake changes."
631,159-13,"In addition, debris coverage, size, altitude, and connectivity with glacial lakes also affected the degree of glacial changes and resulted in the spatial heterogeneity of glacial wastage across the Gyirong River Basin."
632,16-1,Atmospheric methane has been increasing since the beginning of the industrial era due to anthropogenic emissions.
633,16-2,"Methane has many sources, both natural and anthropogenic, and there continues to be considerable uncertainty regarding the contribution of each source to the total methane budget."
634,16-3,"Thus, remote sensing techniques for monitoring and measuring methane emissions are of increasing interest."
635,16-4,"Recently, the Airborne Visible-Infrared Imaging Spectrometer - Next Generation (AVIRIS-NG) has proven to be a valuable instrument for quantitative mapping of methane plumes."
636,16-5,"Despite this success, uncertainties remain regarding the sensitivity of the retrieval algorithms, including the influence of albedo and the impact of surfaces that may cause spurious signals."
637,16-6,"To explore these sensitivities, we applied the Iterative Maximum a Posterior Differential Optical Absorption Spectroscopy (IMAP-DOAS) methane retrieval algorithm to synthetic reflected radiances with variable methane concentrations, albedo, surface cover, and aerosols."
638,16-7,"This allowed for characterizing retrieval performance, including potential sensitivity to variable surfaces, low albedo surfaces, and surfaces known to cause spurious signals."
639,16-8,"We found that dark surfaces (below 0.10 mu Wcm(-2) nm(-1) sr(-1) at 2139 nm), such as water and green vegetation, and materials with absorption features in the 2200-2400 nm range caused higher errors in retrieval results."
640,16-9,We also found that aerosols have little influence on retrievals in the SWIR.
641,16-10,Results from the synthetic scene are consistent with those observed in IMAP-DOAS retrievals for real AVIRIS-NG scenes containing methane plumes from a waste dairy lagoon and coal mine ventilation shafts.
642,16-11,Understanding the effect of surface properties on methane retrievals is important given the increased use of AVIRIS-NG to map gas plumes from a diversity of sources over variable landscapes.
643,160-1,Advances in remote sensing have led to the use of satellite-derived rainfall products to complement the sparse rain gauge data.
644,160-2,"Although these products are globally and some regional bias corrected, they often show substantial differences relative to ground measurements attributed to local and external factors that require systematic consideration."
645,160-3,A decreasing rain gauge network inhibits the continuous validation of these products.
646,160-4,Our proposal to deal with this problem was to use a Bayesian approach to merge the existing historical rain gauge information to create consistent satellite rainfall data for long-term applications.
647,160-5,Monthly bias correction was applied to Climate Hazards Group Infrared Precipitation with Stations (CHIRPS v2) using a corresponding gridded (0.05 degrees) rain gauge data over East Africa for 33 years (1981-2013).
648,160-6,The first 22 years were utilized to derive error fields which were then applied to independent CHIRPS data for 11 years for validation.
649,160-7,Assessments of the approach's influence on the rainfall estimates spatially and temporally were explored.
650,160-8,Results showed a significant spatial reduction of the underestimation and overestimation of systematic errors at both monthly and yearly scales.
651,160-9,"The reduced errors increased with increased rainfall amounts, hence was less so in the relatively drier months."
652,160-10,"The overall monthly reduction of Root Mean Square Difference (RMSD) was between 4% and 60%, and the Mean Absolute Error (MAE) was between 1% and 63%, while the correlations improved by up to 21%."
653,160-11,"Yearly, the RMSD was reduced between 17% and 49%, and the MAE between 13% and 48%, while the increase in correlations was between 9% and 17%."
654,160-12,Decreased yearly bias correction corresponded with years of high rainfall associated with El Nino.
655,160-13,"Results for the assessments of the effectiveness of the Bayesian approach showed that it was more effective in reducing systematic errors related to rainfall magnitudes, but its performance decreased in areas of sparse rain gauge network that insufficiently represented rainfall variabilities."
656,160-14,"This affected areas of deep convection, leading to minimal overestimation reductions associated with the cirrus effect."
657,160-15,"Conversely, significant corrections were during years of low rainfall from shallow convections."
658,160-16,The approach is suitable for long-term applications where consistencies of mean errors can be assumed.
659,161-1,"Standard chlorophyll-a (chl-a) algorithms, which rely on Moderate Resolution Imaging Spectro-radiometer (MODIS) data aboard the Aqua satellite, usually show different performances depending on the area under consideration."
660,161-2,"In this paper, we assessed their accuracy in retrieving the chl-a concentration in the Basilicata Ionian Coastal waters (Ionian Sea, South of Italy)."
661,161-3,"The outputs of one empirical (Med-OC3) and two semi-analytical algorithms, the Garver-Siegel-Maritorena (GSM) and the Generalized Inherent Optical Properties (GIOP) model, have been compared with ground measurements acquired during three different measurement campaigns."
662,161-4,"The achieved results prove the poor accuracy (adjusted R-2 value of 0.12) of the investigated empirical algorithm and, conversely, the good performance of semi-analytical algorithms (adjusted R-2 ranging from 0.74 to 0.79)."
663,161-5,The co-existence of Coloured Dissolved Organic Matter (CDOM) and Non-Algal Particles (NAP) has likely determined large errors in the reflectance ratios used in the OCx form algorithms.
664,161-6,"Finally, a local scale assessment of the bio-optical properties, on the basis of the in situ dataset, allowed for the definition of an operational local scale-tuned version of the MODIS chl-a algorithm, which assured increased accuracy (adjusted R-2 value of 0.86)."
665,161-7,Such a tuned algorithm version can provide useful information which can be used by local authorities within regional management systems.
666,162-1,Forest ecosystems fulfill a whole host of ecosystem functions that are essential for life on our planet.
667,162-2,"However, an unprecedented level of anthropogenic influences is reducing the resilience and stability of our forest ecosystems as well as their ecosystem functions."
668,162-3,"The relationships between drivers, stress, and ecosystem functions in forest ecosystems are complex, multi-faceted, and often non-linear, and yet forest managers, decision makers, and politicians need to be able to make rapid decisions that are data-driven and based on short and long-term monitoring information, complex modeling, and analysis approaches."
669,162-4,"A huge number of long-standing and standardized forest health inventory approaches already exist, and are increasingly integrating remote-sensing based monitoring approaches."
670,162-5,"Unfortunately, these approaches in monitoring, data storage, analysis, prognosis, and assessment still do not satisfy the future requirements of information and digital knowledge processing of the 21st century."
671,162-6,"Therefore, this paper discusses and presents in detail five sets of requirements, including their relevance, necessity, and the possible solutions that would be necessary for establishing a feasible multi-source forest health monitoring network for the 21st century."
672,162-7,"Namely, these requirements are: (1) understanding the effects of multiple stressors on forest health; (2) using remote sensing (RS) approaches to monitor forest health; (3) coupling different monitoring approaches; (4) using data science as a bridge between complex and multidimensional big forest health (FH) data; and (5) a future multi-source forest health monitoring network."
673,162-8,"It became apparent that no existing monitoring approach, technique, model, or platform is sufficient on its own to monitor, model, forecast, or assess forest health and its resilience."
674,162-9,"In order to advance the development of a multi-source forest health monitoring network, we argue that in order to gain a better understanding of forest health in our complex world, it would be conducive to implement the concepts of data science with the components: (i) digitalization; (ii) standardization with metadata management after the FAIR (Findability, Accessibility, Interoperability, and Reusability) principles; (iii) Semantic Web; (iv) proof, trust, and uncertainties; (v) tools for data science analysis; and (vi) easy tools for scientists, data managers, and stakeholders for decision-making support."
675,163-1,"Shanghai, as one of the megacities and economic centers of China, is facing critical water quality challenges."
676,163-2,"This study analyzed the impact of urbanization on the water quality in Shanghai, from 2007 to 2015, using remote sensing (RS) and geographic information system (GIS) techniques."
677,163-3,"Five measurements of water quality were employed: total discharged wastewater volume, general water quality levels, dissolved oxygen (DO), permanganate, and ammonia nitrogen."
678,163-4,The impacts of urban land-use changes on water quality were examined.
679,163-5,An urban index was extracted from satellite image classification and was used to quantify the anthropogenic activities.
680,163-6,"In the watershed level, unit watersheds were delineated from topography and stream segments."
681,163-7,Results showed that the primary contributors of water quality degradation in Shanghai were DO and ammonia nitrogen.
682,163-8,Both indicators expressed clear seasonal patterns that can be explained by agricultural activities and urbanization processes in Shanghai during the study period.
683,163-9,Water quality was also regulated through water use policies.
684,163-10,"For example, the degraded water quality in suburban outskirts and improved water quality was achieved through the enforced wastewater discharge regulations in central Shanghai."
685,163-11,"Analytical findings provide spatially explicit information for governmental management on protecting water resources and controlling wastewater emissions, thus, improving the quality of living environments in this ever-growing megacity."
686,164-1,"Modeling vegetation gross primary productivity (GPP) is crucial to understanding the land-atmosphere interactions and, hence, the global carbon cycle."
687,164-2,"While studies have demonstrated that satellite-based models could well simulate intra-annual variation of vegetation GPP, there is a need to understand our ability to capture interannual GPP variability."
688,164-3,This study compares the spatiotemporal performance of six satellite-based models in regional modeling of annual GPP for deciduous broadleaf forests across the eastern United States.
689,164-4,The 2001-2012 average annual gross primary productivities (AAGPPs) derived from different models have mismatched spatial patterns with divergent changing trends along both latitude and longitude.
690,164-5,Evaluation using flux tower data indicates that some models could have considerable biases on a yearly basis.
691,164-6,"All tested models, despite performing well on the 8-day basis because of the underlying strong seasonality in vegetation productivity, fail to capture interannual variation of GPP across sites and years."
692,164-7,Our study identifies considerable modeling uncertainties on a yearly basis even for an extensively studied biome of deciduous broadleaf forest at both site and large scales.
693,164-8,Improvements to the current satellite-based models have to be made to capture interannual GPP variation in addition to intra-annual variation.
694,165-1,The velocity of ice flow in the Antarctic is a crucial factor to determine ice discharge and thus future sea level rise.
695,165-2,"Feature tracking has been widely used in optical and radar imagery with fine resolution to retrieve flow parameters, although the primitive result may be contaminated by noise."
696,165-3,"In this paper, we present a series of modified post-processing steps, such as SNR thresholding by residual, complex Butterworth filters, and triple standard deviation truncation, to improve the performance of primitive results, and apply it to MODIS-based Mosaic of Antarctica (MOA) datasets."
697,165-4,The final velocity field result displays the general flow pattern of the peripheral Antarctic.
698,165-5,Seventy-eight out of 97 streamlines starting from seed points are smooth and continuous.
699,165-6,The RMSE with 178 manually selected tie points is within 60 m.a(-1).
700,165-7,"The systematic comparison with Making Earth System Data Records for Use in Research Environments (MEaSUREs) datasets in seven drainages shows that the results regarding high magnitude and large-scale ice shelf are highly reliable; absolute mean and median difference are less than 18 m.a(-1), while the result of localized drainage suffered from too much tracking error."
701,165-8,"The relative differences from manually selected and random points are controlled within 8% when speed is beyond 500 m.a(-1), but bias and uncertainty are pronounced when speed is lower than that."
702,165-9,The result through our accuracy control strategy highlights that coarse remote-sensed images such as Moderate Resolution Imaging Spectrophotometer (MODIS) can still offer the capability for comprehensive and long-term continental ice sheet surface velocity mapping.
703,166-1,The increasing frequency of fires inhibits the estimation of carbon reserves in boreal forest ecosystems because fires release significant amounts of carbon into the atmosphere through combustion.
704,166-2,"However, less is known regarding the effects of vegetation succession processes on ecosystem C-flux that follow fires."
705,166-3,This paper describes intra- and inter-annual vegetation restoration trajectories via MODIS time-series and Landsat data.
706,166-4,The temporal and spatial characteristics of the natural succession were analyzed from 2000 to 2016.
707,166-5,"Finally, we regressed post-fire MODIS EVI, LST and LSWI values onto GPP and NPP values to identify the main limiting factors during post-fire carbon exchange."
708,166-6,"The results show immediate variations after the fire event, with EVI and LSWI decreasing by 0.21 and 0.31, respectively, and the LST increasing to 6.89 degrees C."
709,166-7,"After this initial variation, subsequent fire-induced variations were significantly smaller; instead, seasonality began governing the change characteristics."
710,166-8,"The greatest differences in EVI, LST and LSWI were observed in August and September compared to those in other months (0.29, 6.9 and 0.35, respectively), including July, which was the second month after the fire."
711,166-9,"We estimated the mean EVI recovery periods under different fire intensities (approximately 10, 12 and 16 years): the LST recovery time is one year earlier than that of the EVI."
712,166-10,"GPP and NPP decreased after the fire by 22-45 g C.m(-2).month(-1) (30-80%) and 0.13-0.35 kg C.m(-2).year(-1) (20-60%), respectively."
713,166-11,"Excluding the winter period, when no photosynthesis occurred, the correlation between the EVI and GPP was the strongest, and the correlation coefficient varied with the burn intensity."
714,166-12,"When changes in EVI, LST and LSWI after the fire in the boreal forest were more significant, the severity of the fire determined the magnitude of the changes, and the seasonality aggravated these changes."
715,166-13,"On the other hand, the seasonality is another important factor that affects vegetation restoration and land-surface energy fluxes in boreal forests."
716,166-14,"The strong correlations between EVI and GPP/NPP reveal that the C-flux can be simply and directly estimated on a per-pixel basis from EVI data, which can be used to accurately estimate land-surface energy fluxes during vegetation restoration and reduce uncertainties in the estimation of forests' carbon reserves."
717,167-1,Flooding is extremely dangerous when a river overflows to inundate an urban area.
718,167-2,"From 1995 to 2016, North Korea (NK) experienced extensive damage to life and property almost every year due to a levee breach resulting from typhoons and heavy rainfall during the summer monsoon season."
719,167-3,"Recently, Hoeryeong City (2016) experienced heavy rain during Typhoon Lionrock, and the resulting flood killed and injured many people (68,900) and destroyed numerous buildings and settlements (11,600)."
720,167-4,The NK state media described it as the most significant national disaster since 1945.
721,167-5,"Thus, almost all annual repeat occurrences of floods in NK have had a severe impact, which makes it necessary to figure out the extent of floods to restore the damaged environment."
722,167-6,"However, this is difficult due to inaccessibility."
723,167-7,"Under such a situation, optical remote sensing (RS) data and radar RS data along with a logistic regression were utilized in this study to develop modeling for flood-damaged area delineation."
724,167-8,High-resolution web-based satellite imagery was also interpreted to confirm the results of the study.
725,168-1,"The continuum of the SWIR (short-wave infrared) signals from 1320 to 1650 nm contains valuable information for effectively diagnosing water, chlorophyll, and nitrogen content."
726,168-2,The SWIR spectra of in situ spectroradiometric data and airborne spectrometric images are frequently contaminated by significant noise.
727,168-3,"Based on a Logistic-Gaussian complex signal model (LGCM), the noise-free signals at 1330-1349 and 1411-1430 nm wavelengths can provide critical bases for restoring the 1350-1410 nm wavelength signals for a single point of data."
728,168-4,This paper proposes a generalized LGCM (GLGCM) technique to expand the ability of LGCM to process large data with variant reflectance values.
729,168-5,A 12-year-old red cypress plantation located in a central Taiwan temperate forest was selected for this study.
730,168-6,Hundreds of reflectance spectra of tree crowns were obtained using an ASD FR Spectroradiometer.
731,168-7,"The in-laboratory blank test showed that the GLGCM technique was able to achieve sufficient performance with an RMSE (root mean square error) of 0.0015 +/- 0.0005 and 0.0011 +/- 0.0005 for the front-edge and end-edge signal bases respectively, and 0.0014 +/- 0.0006 in between the two signal bases."
732,168-8,A significant level of noise between -0.2 and 0.4 was successfully removed from the in situ contaminated reflectance in the 1350-1410 nm wavelengths.
733,168-9,"The estimation bias for the signals of front-edge and end-edge bases was low, averaging 0.0031 +/- 0.0003 and 0.0032 +/- 0.0012."
734,168-10,The consistency between the blank test and the in situ experimental results indicates that the GLGCM technique has potential in using batch processing to fix the problem of the noisy SWIR spectra in spectroradiometeric data and also airborne spectrometric images.
735,169-1,"Yunnan pine shoot beetles (PSB), Tomicus yunnanensis and Tomicus minor have spread through southwestern China in the last five years, leading to millions of hectares of forest being damaged."
736,169-2,"Thus, there is an urgent need to develop an effective approach for accurate early warning and damage assessment of PSB outbreaks."
737,169-3,Remote sensing is one of the most efficient methods for this purpose.
738,169-4,"Despite many studies existing on the mountain pine beetle (MPB), very little work has been undertaken on assessing PSB stress using remote sensing."
739,169-5,The objective of this paper was to develop a spectral linear mixing model aided by radiative transfer (RT) and a new Yellow Index (YI) to simulate the reflectance of heterogeneous canopies containing damaged needles and quantitatively inverse their PSB stress.
740,169-6,"The YI, the fraction of dead needles, is a physically-explicit stress indicator that represents the plot shoots damage ratio (plot SDR)."
741,169-7,"The major steps of this methods include: (1) LIBERTY2 was developed to simulate the reflectance of damaged needles using YI to linearly mix the green needle spectra with the dead needle spectra; (2) LIBERTY2 was coupled with the INFORM model to scale the needle spectra to the canopy scale; and (3) a look-up table (LUT) was created against Sentinel 2 (S2) imagery and inversed leaf chlorophyll content (LCC), green leaf area index (LAI) and plot SDR."
742,169-8,"The results show that (1) LIBERTY2 effectively simulated the reflectance spectral values on infested needles (mean relative error (MRE) = 1.4-18%), and the YI can indicate the degrees of needles damage; (2) the coupled LIBERTY2-INFORM model is suitable to estimate LAI (R-2 = 0.73, RMSE = 0.17 m m(-2), NRMSE = 11.41% and the index of agreement (IOA) = 0.92) and LCC (R-2 = 0.49, RMSE = 56.24 mg m(-2), NRMSE = 25.22% and IOA = 0.72), and is better than the original LIBERTY model (LAI: R-2 = 0.38, RMSE = 0.43 m m(-2), NRMSE = 28.85% and IOA = 0.68; LCC: R-2 = 0.34, RMSE = 76.44 mg m(-2), NRMSE = 34.23% and IOA = 0.57); and (3) the inversed YI is positively correlated with the measured plot SDR (R-2 = 0.40, RMSE = 0.15)."
743,169-9,"We conclude that the LIBERTY2 model improved the reflectance simulation accuracy of both the needles and canopies, making it suitable for assessing PSB stress."
744,169-10,The YI has the potential to assess PSB damage.
745,17-1,"The temporal dynamics of optimum stomatal conductance (g(smax)), as well differences between C-3 and C-4 crops, have rarely been considered in previous remote sensing (RS)-based Jarvis-type canopy conductance (G(c)) models."
746,17-2,"To address this issue, a RS-based two-leaf Jarvis-type G(c) model, RST-G(c), was optimized and validated for C-3 and C-4 crops using 19 crop flux sites across Europe, North America, and China."
747,17-3,"RST-G(c) included restrictive functions for air temperature, vapor pressure deficit, and soil water deficit, and it used satellite-retrieved NDVI to formulate the temporal variation of g(smax) defined at a photosynthetic photon flux density (PPFD) of 2000 mu mol m(-2) s(-1) (g(sm, 2000))."
748,17-4,Results showed that the parameters of RST-G(c) differed between C-3 and C-4 crops.
749,17-5,RST-G(c) successfully simulated variations in Penman-Monteith (PM)-derived daytime G(c) with R-2 = 0.57 for both C-3 and C-4 crops.
750,17-6,RST-G(c) was incorporated into a revised evapotranspiration (ET) model and a new gross primary productivity (GPP) model.
751,17-7,The two models were validated at 19 crop flux sites.
752,17-8,Daily mean inputs were generally incorporated into a PM approach to model daily transpiration.
753,17-9,"This is inappropriate because available energy and stomatal conductance vary significantly on a diurnal basis, with both non-linearly regulating transpiration rate."
754,17-10,The PM approach with daily mean inputs produced unreasonable transpiration rate estimates.
755,17-11,"Efforts were made in the revised ET model (denoted as RS-WBPM2), which was modified from the water balance based RS-PM (RS-WBPM) model of Bai et al. (2017), to address this issue by calculating transpiration using daytime inputs."
756,17-12,"The photosynthesis-based stomatal conductance model, developed by Ball et al. (1987a) and improved by Leuning (1995) (BBL model), was inverted to calculate GPP using canopy conductance; the inverted model was denoted as IBBL."
757,17-13,"Cross validation showed good agreement between flux tower measurements and modeled ET (R-2 = 0.79, RMSE (root mean standard error) = 20.66 W m(-2) for daily ET and R-2 = 0.87, RMSE = 15.32 W m(-2) for 16-day ET) and GPP (R-2 = 0.83, RMSE = 2.49 gC m(-2) d(-1) for daily GPP and R-2 = 0.86, RMSE = 1.96 gC m(-2) d(-1) for 16-day GPP) for the two models."
758,17-14,Within-site validations demonstrated the successful performance of the two models at 18 sites (albeit with one outlier).
759,17-15,Inter-site variations in ET and GPP were also successfully reproduced by the models.
760,17-16,"NDVI-derived g(sm, 2000) outperformed the fixed g(sm, 2000) in both ET and GPP estimates."
761,17-17,The results imply that the RS-WBPM2 and IBBL models are useful tools for modeling regional and global ET and GPP.
762,170-1,Aerial infrared point target detection under nonstationary background clutter is a crucial yet challenging issue in the field of remote sensing.
763,170-2,This paper presents a novel omnidirectional multiscale morphological method for aerial point target detection based on a dual-band model.
764,170-3,"Considering that the clutter noise conforms to the Gaussian distribution, the single-band detection model under the Neyman-Pearson (NP) criterion is established first, and then the optimal fused probability of detection under the dual-band model is deduced according to the And fusion rule."
765,170-4,"Next, the omnidirectional multiscale morphological Top-hat algorithm is proposed to extract all the possible targets distributing in every direction, and the local difference criterion is employed to eliminate the residual background edges further."
766,170-5,The dynamic threshold-to-noise ratio (TNR) is adjusted to obtain the optimal probability of detection under the constant false alarm rate (CFAR) criterion.
767,170-6,"Finally, the dim point target is extracted after dual-band data correlation."
768,170-7,The experimental result demonstrates that the proposed method achieves a high probability of detection and performs well with respect to suppressing complex background when compared with common algorithms.
769,170-8,"In addition, it also has the advantage of low complexity and easy implementation in real-time systems."
770,171-1,Phytoplankton community structure and phytoplankton size class (PSC) are linked to ecological and biogeochemical changes in the oceanic environment.
771,171-2,"Many models developed to obtain the fraction of PSCs from satellite remote sensing have only been evaluated in open oceans, and very limited effort has been carried out to report on the performance of these PSC models in productive continental shelf waters."
772,171-3,"In this study, we evaluated the performance of nine PSC models in the coastal Northwest Atlantic (NWA) by comparison of in situ phytoplankton pigment measurements with coincidental satellite data from the Sea-Viewing Wide Field-of-View Sensor (SeaWiFS), Moderate-resolution Imaging Spectroradiometer (MODIS), and the Visible Infrared Imaging Radiometer Suite (VIIRS)."
773,171-4,"Our results show that no PSC model retrieved all three phytoplankton size classes (pico-, nano-, and micro-phytoplankton) with reliable accuracy in the region of interest."
774,171-5,"In particular, these PSC models showed poor performance for retrieval of the picophytoplankton fraction of total phytoplankton in our study region, which could be related to the under-representation of pico-dominated samples in the productive waters of the NWA."
775,171-6,"For the accuracy of retrieved microphytoplankton and combined nano-pico phytoplankton fraction, the regional model developed by Devred et al. (2011) yielded the best result, followed by the model of Brewin et al. (2011)."
776,171-7,The model of Devred et al. (2011) was applied to satellite-derived chlorophyll-a concentration from the Ocean Color Climate Change Initiative (OC-CCI) archive in the NWA from 1998 to 2016.
777,171-8,We report solely on the microphytoplankton biomass and fraction given the inverse relationship that exists with the nano-pico class.
778,171-9,The multi-decadal trend along with the deseasonalized trend of microphytoplankton fraction was computed and analyzed for six biogeochemical provinces located in the NWA.
779,171-10,"Over the 19-year time series, there were significant, positive trends for four of the six provinces, with a slope of 0.36%.yr(-1) in the Northwest Continental Shelf (NWCS), 0.25%.yr(-1) in the Arctic Waters (ARCT), 0.12%.yr(-1) in the Slope Waters (SW) and 0.06%.yr(-1) in the Gulf Stream (GFST)."
780,171-11,"Strong positive anomalies of microphytoplankton fraction were found in winter months in NWCS between 2009 and 2014, which could be associated with changes in environmental factors."
781,172-1,Droughts can severely reduce the productivity of agricultural lands and forests.
782,172-2,The United States Department of Agriculture (USDA) Southeast Regional Climate Hub (SERCH) has launched the Lately Identified Geospecific Heightened Threat System (LIGHTS) to inform its users of potential water deficiency threats.
783,172-3,The system identifies droughts and other climate anomalies such as extreme precipitation and heat stress.
784,172-4,"However, the LIGHTS model lacks input from soil moisture observations."
785,172-5,This research aims to develop a simple and easy-to-interpret soil moisture and drought warning indexstandardized soil moisture index (SSI)by fusing the space-borne Soil Moisture Active Passive (SMAP) soil moisture data with the North American Land Data Assimilation System (NLDAS) Noah land surface model (LSM) output.
786,172-6,Ground truth soil moisture data from the Soil Climate Analysis Network (SCAN) were collected for validation.
787,172-7,"As a result, the accuracy of using SMAP to monitor soil moisture content generally displayed a good statistical correlation with the SCAN data."
788,172-8,The validation through the Palmer drought severity index (PDSI) and normalized difference water index (NDWI) suggested that SSI was effective and sensitive for short-term drought monitoring across large areas.
789,173-1,The accuracy of three satellite models of primary production (PP) of varying complexity was assessed against 95 in situ C-14 uptake measurements from the North East Atlantic Ocean (NEA).
790,173-2,"The models were run using the European Space Agency (ESA), Ocean Colour Climate Change Initiative (OC-CCI) version 3.0 data."
791,173-3,"The objectives of the study were to determine which is the most accurate PP model for the region in different provinces and seasons, what is the accuracy of the models using both high (daily) and low (eight day) temporal resolution OC-CCI data, and whether the performance of the models is improved by implementing a photoinhibition function?"
792,173-4,"The Platt-Sathyendranath primary production model (PPPSM) was the most accurate over all NEA provinces and, specifically, in the Atlantic Arctic province (ARCT) and North Atlantic Drift (NADR) provinces."
793,173-5,"The implementation of a photoinhibition function in the PPPSM reduced its accuracy, especially at lower range PP."
794,173-6,"The Vertical Generalized Production Model-VGPM (PPVGPM) tended to over-estimate PP, especially in summer and in the NADR."
795,173-7,The accuracy of PPVGPM improved with the implementation of a photoinhibition function in summer.
796,173-8,"The absorption model of primary production (PPAph), with and without photoinhibition, was the least accurate model for the NEA."
797,173-9,Mapped images of each model showed that the PPVGPM was 150% higher in the NADR compared to PPPSM.
798,173-10,"In the North Atlantic Subtropical Gyre (NAST) province, PPAph was 355% higher than PPPSM, whereas PPVGPM was 215% higher."
799,173-11,"A sensitivity analysis indicated that chlorophyll-a (Chl a), or the absorption of phytoplankton, at 443 nm (a(ph) (443)) caused the largest error in the estimation of PP, followed by the photosynthetic rate terms and then the irradiance functions used for each model."
800,174-1,Fusing multiple change detection results has great potentials in dealing with the spectral variability in multitemporal very high-resolution (VHR) remote sensing images.
801,174-2,"However, it is difficult to solve the problem of uncertainty, which mainly includes the inaccuracy of each candidate change map and the conflicts between different results."
802,174-3,Dempster-Shafer theory (D-S) is an effective method to model uncertainties and combine multiple evidences.
803,174-4,"Therefore, in this paper, we proposed an urban change detection method for VHR images by fusing multiple change detection methods with D-S evidence theory."
804,174-5,"Change vector analysis (CVA), iteratively reweighted multivariate alteration detection (IRMAD), and iterative slow feature analysis (ISFA) were utilized to obtain the candidate change maps."
805,174-6,The final change detection result is generated by fusing the three evidences with D-S evidence theory and a segmentation object map.
806,174-7,"The experiment indicates that the proposed method can obtain the best performance in detection rate, false alarm rate, and comprehensive indicators."
807,175-1,"Despite recent advances of deep Convolutional Neural Networks (CNNs) in various computer vision tasks, their potential for classification of multispectral remote sensing images has not been thoroughly explored."
808,175-2,"In particular, the applications of deep CNNs using optical remote sensing data have focused on the classification of very high-resolution aerial and satellite data, owing to the similarity of these data to the large datasets in computer vision."
809,175-3,"Accordingly, this study presents a detailed investigation of state-of-the-art deep learning tools for classification of complex wetland classes using multispectral RapidEye optical imagery."
810,175-4,"Specifically, we examine the capacity of seven well-known deep convnets, namely DenseNet121, InceptionV3, VGG16, VGG19, Xception, ResNet50, and InceptionResNetV2, for wetland mapping in Canada."
811,175-5,"In addition, the classification results obtained from deep CNNs are compared with those based on conventional machine learning tools, including Random Forest and Support Vector Machine, to further evaluate the efficiency of the former to classify wetlands."
812,175-6,The results illustrate that the full-training of convnets using five spectral bands outperforms the other strategies for all convnets.
813,175-7,"InceptionResNetV2, ResNet50, and Xception are distinguished as the top three convnets, providing state-of-the-art classification accuracies of 96.17%, 94.81%, and 93.57%, respectively."
814,175-8,"The classification accuracies obtained using Support Vector Machine (SVM) and Random Forest (RF) are 74.89% and 76.08%, respectively, considerably inferior relative to CNNs."
815,175-9,"Importantly, InceptionResNetV2 is consistently found to be superior compared to all other convnets, suggesting the integration of Inception and ResNet modules is an efficient architecture for classifying complex remote sensing scenes such as wetlands."
816,176-1,In-situ monitoring of lake water quality in synergy with satellite remote sensing represents the latest scientific trend in many water quality monitoring programs worldwide.
817,176-2,This study investigated the suitability of the Operational Land Imager (OLI) instrument onboard the Landsat 8 satellite platform in accurately estimating key water quality parameters such as chlorophyll-a and nutrient concentrations.
818,176-3,As a case study the largest freshwater body of Greece (Trichonis Lake) was used.
819,176-4,Two Landsat 8 images covering the study site were acquired on 30 October 2013 and 30 August 2014 respectively.
820,176-5,Near concurrent in-situ observations from two water sampling campaigns were also acquired from 22 stations across the lake under study.
821,176-6,In-situ measurements (nutrients and chlorophyll-a concentrations) were statistically correlated with various spectral band combinations derived from the Landsat imagery of year 2014.
822,176-7,"Subsequently, the most statistically promising predictive models were applied to the satellite image of 2013 and validation was conducted using in-situ data of 2013 as reference."
823,176-8,"Results showed a relatively variable statistical relationship between the in-situ and reflectances (R logchl-a: 0.58, R NH4+: 0.26, R chl-a: 0.44)."
824,176-9,Correlation coefficient (R) values reported of up to 0.7 for ammonium concentrations and also up to 0.5 and up to 0.4 for chl-a concentration and chl-a concentrations respectively.
825,176-10,"These results represent a higher accuracy of Landsat 8 in comparison to its predecessors in the Landsat satellites series, as evidenced in the literature."
826,176-11,"Our findings suggest that Landsat 8 has a promising capability in estimating water quality components in an oligotrophic freshwater body characterized by a complete absence of any quantitative, temporal and spatial variance, as is the case of Trichonis lake."
827,176-12,"Yet, even with the presence of a lot of ground information as was the case in our study, a quantitatively accurate estimation of water quality constituents in coastal/inland waters remains a great challenge."
828,176-13,"The launch of sophisticated spaceborne sensing systems, such as that of Landsat 8, can assist in improving our ability to estimate freshwater lake properties from space."
829,177-1,The Aquarius end-of-mission (Version 5) salinity data set was released in December 2017.
830,177-2,This article gives a comprehensive overview of the main steps of the Level 2 salinity retrieval algorithm.
831,177-3,"In particular, we will discuss the corrections for wind induced surface roughness, atmospheric oxygen absorption, reflected galactic radiation and side-lobe intrusion from land surfaces."
832,177-4,"Most of these corrections have undergone major updates from previous versions, which has helped mitigating temporal and zonal biases."
833,177-5,Our article also discusses the ocean target calibration for Aquarius Version 5.
834,177-6,We show how formal error estimates for the Aquarius retrievals can be obtained by perturbing the input to the algorithm.
835,177-7,The performance of the Aquarius Version 5 salinity retrievals is evaluated against salinity measurements from the ARGO network and the HYCOM model.
836,177-8,"When stratified as function of sea surface temperature or sea surface wind speed, the difference between Aquarius Version 5 and ARGO is within +/- 0.1 psu."
837,177-9,The estimated global RMS uncertainty for monthly 100 km averages is 0.128 psu for the Aquarius Version 5 retrievals.
838,177-10,"Finally, we show how the Aquarius Version 5 salinity retrieval algorithm is adapted to retrieve salinity from the Soil-Moisture Active Passion (SMAP) mission."
839,178-1,"A detailed and state-of-the-art landslide inventory map including precise landslide location is greatly required for landslide susceptibility, hazard, and risk assessments."
840,178-2,"Traditional techniques employed for landslide detection in tropical regions include field surveys, synthetic aperture radar techniques, and optical remote sensing."
841,178-3,"However, these techniques are time consuming and costly."
842,178-4,"Furthermore, complications arise for the generation of accurate landslide location maps in these regions due to dense vegetation in tropical forests."
843,178-5,"Given its ability to penetrate vegetation cover, high-resolution airborne light detection and ranging (LiDAR) is typically employed to generate accurate landslide maps."
844,178-6,The object-based technique generally consists of many homogeneous pixels grouped together in a meaningful way through image segmentation.
845,178-7,"In this paper, in order to address the limitations of this approach, the final decision is executed using Dempster-Shafer theory (DST) rule combination based on probabilistic output from object-based support vector machine (SVM), random forest (RF), and K-nearest neighbor (KNN) classifiers."
846,178-8,"Therefore, this research proposes an efficient framework by combining three object-based classifiers using the DST method."
847,178-9,"Consequently, an existing supervised approach (i.e., fuzzy-based segmentation parameter optimizer) was adopted to optimize multiresolution segmentation parameters such as scale, shape, and compactness."
848,178-10,"Subsequently, a correlation-based feature selection (CFS) algorithm was employed to select the relevant features."
849,178-11,"Two study sites were selected to implement the method of landslide detection and evaluation of the proposed method (subset ""A"" for implementation and subset ""B"" for the transferrable)."
850,178-12,"The DST method performed well in detecting landslide locations in tropical regions such as Malaysia, with potential applications in other similarly vegetated regions."
851,179-1,Afromontane forests are biodiversity hotspots and provide essential ecosystem services.
852,179-2,"However, they are under pressure as a result of an expanding human population and the impact of climate change."
853,179-3,In many instances electric fencing has become a necessary management strategy to protect forest integrity and reduce human-wildlife conflict.
854,179-4,"The impact of confining hitherto migratory elephant populations within forests remains unknown, and monitoring largely inaccessible areas is challenging."
855,179-5,"We explore the application of remote sensing to monitor the impact of confinement, employing the Breaks For Additive Season and Trend (BFAST) time-series decomposition method over a 15-year period on Moderate Resolution Imaging Spectroradiometer (MODIS) Enhanced Vegetation Index (EVI) (MOD13Q1) datasets for two Kenyan forests."
856,179-6,"Results indicated that BFAST was able to identify disturbances from anthropogenic, fire and elephant damage."
857,179-7,"Sequential monitoring enabled the detection of gradual changes in the forest canopy, with degradation and regeneration being observed in both sites."
858,179-8,"Annual rates of forest loss in both areas were significantly lower than reported in other studies on Afromontane forests, suggesting that installing fences has reduced land-use conversion from human-related disturbances."
859,179-9,"Negative changes in EVI were predominantly gradual degradation rather than large-scale, abrupt clearings of the forest."
860,179-10,Results presented here demonstrate that BFAST can be used to monitor biotic and abiotic drivers of change in Afromontane forests.
861,18-1,"The occurrence of water shortages ascribed to projected climate change, especially in the Mediterranean region, fosters the interest in remote sensing (RS) applications to optimize water use in agriculture."
862,18-2,Remote sensing evapotranspiration and water demand estimation over large cultivated areas were used to manage irrigation to minimize losses during the crop growing cycle.
863,18-3,"The research aimed to explore the potential of the MultiSpectral Instrument (MSI) sensor on board Sentinel-2A to estimate crop parameters, mainly surface albedo (alpha) and Leaf Area Index (LAI) that influence the dynamics of potential evapotranspiration (ETp) and Irrigation Water Requirements (IWR) of processing tomato crop (Solanum lycopersicum L.)."
864,18-4,Maximum tomato ETp was calculated according to the FAO Penman-Monteith equation (FAO-56 PM) using appropriate values of canopy parameters derived by processing Sentinel-2A data in combination with daily weather information.
865,18-5,"For comparison, we used the actual crop evapotranspiration (ETa) derived from the soil water balance (SWB) module in the Environmental Policy Integrated Climate (EPIC) model and calibrated with in-situ Root Zone Soil Moisture (RZSM)."
866,18-6,"The experiment was set up in a privately-owned farm located in the Tarquinia irrigation district (Central Italy) during two growing seasons, within the framework of the EU Project FATIMA (FArming Tools for external nutrient Inputs and water Management)."
867,18-7,"The results showed that canopy growth, maximum evapotranspiration (ETp) and IWR were accurately inferred from satellite observations following seasonal rainfall and air temperature patterns."
868,18-8,"The net estimated IWR from satellite observations for the two-growing seasons was about 272 and 338 mm in 2016 and 2017, respectively."
869,18-9,"Such estimated requirement was lower compared with the actual amount supplied by the farmer with sprinkler and drip micro-irrigation system in both growing seasons resulting in 364 (276 mm drip micro-irrigation, and 88 mm sprinkler) and 662 (574 mm drip micro-irrigation, and 88 mm sprinkler) mm, respectively."
870,18-10,"Our findings indicated the suitability of Sentinel-2A to predict tomato water demand at field level, providing useful information for optimizing the irrigation over extended farmland."
871,180-1,The photochemical reflectance index (PRI) is calculated from vegetation narrowband reflectance in two bands in the visible part of the spectrum.
872,180-2,Variations in PRI are associated with changes in the xanthophyll cycle pigments which regulate the light use efficiency of vegetation.
873,180-3,Correlations have been found between remotely-sensed PRI and various photosynthetic productivity parameters at the scales from leaves to landscapes.
874,180-4,Environmental satellites can provide only an instantaneous value of this index at the time of overpass.
875,180-5,The diurnal course of needle (leaf) PRI needs to be known in order to link the instantaneous values robustly with photosynthetic parameters at time scales exceeding one day.
876,180-6,This information is not currently available in the scientific literature.
877,180-7,Here we present the daily cycle of Scots pine needle and canopy PRI in a southern boreal forest zone in the presence of direct solar radiation during the peak growing season of two consecutive years.
878,180-8,We found the PRI of the needles which are exposed to direct radiation to have a distinct diurnal cycle with constant or slightly increasing values before noon and a daily minimum in the afternoon.
879,180-9,The cycle in needle PRI was not correlated with that in the incident photosynthetic photon flux density (PPFD).
880,180-10,"However, when PPFD was above 1000 mol m(-2) s(-1), approximately between 8 a.m. and 5 p.m., needle PRI was correlated with the light use efficiency (LUE), measured with shoot chambers."
881,180-11,"The timing of the minimum needle PRI coincided with the minimum canopy value, as measured by an independent sensor above the canopy, but the correlation between the two variables was not significant."
882,180-12,Our field results corroborate the applicability of needle PRI in monitoring the daily variation in LUE.
883,180-13,"However, to apply this to remote sensing of seasonal photosynthetic productivity, the daily cycle of leaf PRI needs to be known for the specific vegetation type."
884,181-1,"Terrestrial evapotranspiration (ET) is a central process in the climate system, is a major component in the terrestrial water budget, and is responsible for the distribution of water and energy on land surfaces especially in arid and semiarid areas."
885,181-2,"In order to inform water management decisions especially in scarce water environments, it is important to assess ET vegetation use by differentiating irrigated socio-economic areas and natural ecosystems."
886,181-3,The global remote sensing ET product MOD16 has proven to underestimate ET in semiarid regions where ET is very sensitive to soil moisture.
887,181-4,"The objective of this research was to test whether a modified version of the remote sensing ET model PT-JPL, proven to perform well in drylands at Eddy Covariance flux sites using the land surface temperature as a proxy to the surface moisture status (PT-JPL-thermal), could be up-scaled at regional levels introducing also a new formulation for net radiation from various MODIS products."
888,181-5,"We applied three methods to track the spatial and temporal characteristics of ET in the World Heritage UNESCO Donana region: (i) a locally calibrated hydrological model (WATEN), (ii) the PT-JPL-thermal, and (iii) the global remote sensing ET product MOD16."
889,181-6,"The PT-JPL-thermal showed strong agreement with the WATEN ET in-situ calibrated estimates (rho = 0.78, rho(1month-lag) = 0.94) even though the MOD16 product did not (rho = 0.48)."
890,181-7,The PT-JPL-thermal approach has proven to be a robust remote sensing model for detecting ET at a regional level in Mediterranean environments and it requires only air temperature and incoming solar radiation from climatic databases apart from freely available satellite products.
891,182-1,"The timely estimation of crop biomass and nitrogen content is a crucial step in various tasks in precision agriculture, for example in fertilization optimization."
892,182-2,Remote sensing using drones and aircrafts offers a feasible tool to carry out this task.
893,182-3,"Our objective was to develop and assess a methodology for crop biomass and nitrogen estimation, integrating spectral and 3D features that can be extracted using airborne miniaturized multispectral, hyperspectral and colour (RGB) cameras."
894,182-4,"We used the Random Forest (RF) as the estimator, and in addition Simple Linear Regression (SLR) was used to validate the consistency of the RF results."
895,182-5,The method was assessed with empirical datasets captured of a barley field and a grass silage trial site using a hyperspectral camera based on the Fabry-Perot interferometer (FPI) and a regular RGB camera onboard a drone and an aircraft.
896,182-6,"Agricultural reference measurements included fresh yield (FY), dry matter yield (DMY) and amount of nitrogen."
897,182-7,"In DMY estimation of barley, the Pearson Correlation Coefficient (PCC) and the normalized Root Mean Square Error (RMSE%) were at best 0.95% and 33.2%, respectively; and in the grass DMY estimation, the best results were 0.79% and 1.9%, respectively."
898,182-8,"In the nitrogen amount estimations of barley, the PCC and RMSE% were at best 0.97% and 21.6%, respectively."
899,182-9,"In the biomass estimation, the best results were obtained when integrating hyperspectral and 3D features, but the integration of RGB images and 3D features also provided results that were almost as good."
900,182-10,"In nitrogen content estimation, the hyperspectral camera gave the best results."
901,182-11,We concluded that the integration of spectral and high spatial resolution 3D features and radiometric calibration was necessary to optimize the accuracy.
902,183-1,Information about changes in the population sizes of wild animals is extremely important for conservation and management.
903,183-2,"Wild animal populations have been estimated using statistical methods, but it is difficult to apply such methods to large areas."
904,183-3,"To address this problem, we have developed several support systems for the automated detection of wild animals in remote sensing images."
905,183-4,"In this study, we applied one of the developed algorithms, the computer-aided detection of moving wild animals (DWA) algorithm, to thermal remote sensing images."
906,183-5,We also performed several analyses to confirm that the DWA algorithm is useful for thermal images and to clarify the optimal conditions for obtaining thermal images (during predawn hours and on overcast days).
907,183-6,We developed a method based on the algorithm to extract moving wild animals from thermal remote sensing images.
908,183-7,"Then, accuracy was evaluated by applying the method to airborne thermal images in a wide area."
909,183-8,We found that the producer's accuracy of the method was approximately 77.3% and the user's accuracy of the method was approximately 29.3%.
910,183-9,This means that the proposed method can reduce the person-hours required to survey moving wild animals from large numbers of thermal remote sensing images.
911,183-10,"Furthermore, we confirmed the extracted sika deer candidates in a pair of images and found 24 moving objects that were not identified by visual inspection by an expert."
912,183-11,"Therefore, the proposed method can also reduce oversight when identifying moving wild animals."
913,183-12,The detection accuracy is expected to increase by setting suitable observation conditions for surveying moving wild animals.
914,183-13,"Accordingly, we also discuss the required observation conditions."
915,183-14,The discussions about the required observation conditions would be extremely useful for people monitoring animal population changes using thermal remote sensing images.
916,184-1,Aquaculture makes a crucial contribution to global food security and protein intake and is a basis for many livelihoods.
917,184-2,"Every second fish consumed today is produced in aquaculture systems, mainly in land-based water ponds situated along the coastal areas."
918,184-3,"Satellite remote sensing enables high-resolution mapping of pond aquaculture, facilitating inventory analyses to support sustainable development of the planet's valuable coastal ecosystems."
919,184-4,"Free, full and open data from the Copernicus earth observation missions opens up new potential for the detection and monitoring of aquaculture from space."
920,184-5,"High-resolution time series data acquired by active microwave instruments aboard the Sentinel-1 satellites and fully automated, object-based image analysis allow the identification of aquaculture ponds."
921,184-6,"In view of the diversity and complexity in the production of aquaculture products, yield and production varies greatly among species."
922,184-7,"Although national statistics on aquaculture production exist, there is a large gap of pond-specific aquaculture production quantities."
923,184-8,"In this regard, earth observation-based mapping and monitoring of pond aquaculture can be used to estimate production and has great potential for global production projections."
924,184-9,"For the deltas of the Mekong River, Red River, Pearl River, and Yellow River, as one of the world's most significant aquaculture production regions, we detected aquaculture ponds from high spatial resolution Sentinel-1 Synthetic Aperture Radar (SAR) data."
925,184-10,"We collected aquaculture production and yield statistics at national, regional and local levels to link earth observation-based findings to the size, number and distribution of aquaculture ponds with production estimation."
926,184-11,"With the SAR derived mapping product, it is possible for the first time to assess aquaculture on single pond level at a regional scale and use that information for spatial analyses and production estimation."
927,185-1,"Aerosols can absorb and scatter surface solar radiation (SSR), which is called the aerosol radiative forcing effect (ARF)."
928,185-2,"Great efforts have been made for the estimation of the aerosol optical depth (AOD), SSR and ARF using meteorological measurements and satellite observations."
929,185-3,"However, the accuracy, and spatial and temporal resolutions of these existing AOD, SSR and ARF models should be improved to meet the application requirements, due to the uncertainties and gaps of input parameters."
930,185-4,"In this study, an optimized back propagation (BP) artificial neural network (Genetic_BP) was developed for improving the estimation of the AOD values."
931,185-5,The retrieved AOD values using the Genetic_BP model and meteorological measurements at China Meteorological Administration (CMA) stations were used to calculate SSR and bottom of the atmosphere (BOA) ARF (ARFB) using Yang's Hybrid model (YHM).
932,185-6,The result show that the Genetic_BP could be used for estimating AOD values with high accuracy (R = 0.866 for CASNET (China Aerosol Remote Sensing Network) stations and R = 0.865 for AERONET (Aerosol Robotic Network) stations).
933,185-7,"The estimated SSR also showed a good agreement with SSR measurements at 96 CMA radiation stations, with RMSE, MAE, R and R-2 of 29.27%, 23.77%, 0.948, and 0.899, respectively."
934,185-8,"The estimated ARFB values are also highly correlated with the AERONET ARFB ones with RMSE, MAE, R and R-2 of -35.47%, -25.33%, 0.843, and 0.711, respectively."
935,185-9,"Finally, the spatial and temporal variations of AOD, SSR, and ARFB values over Mainland China were investigated."
936,185-10,Both AOD and SSR values are generally higher in summer than in other seasons.
937,185-11,The ARFB are generally stronger in spring and summer than in other seasons.
938,185-12,"The ranges for the monthly mean AOD, SSR and ARFB values over Mainland China are 0.183-0.333, 10.218-24.196 MJ m(-2) day(-1) and -2.986 to -1.244 MJ m(-2) day(-1), respectively."
939,185-13,"The Qinghai-Tibetan Plateau has always been an area with the highest SSR, the lowest AOD and the weakest ARFB."
940,185-14,"In contrast, the Sichuan Basin has always been an area with low SSR, high AOD, and strong ARFB."
941,185-15,"The newly proposed AOD model may be of vital importance for improving the accuracy and computational efficiency of AOD, SSR and ARFB estimations for solar energy applications, ecological modeling, and energy policy."
942,186-1,The use of remote sensing to monitor surface water bodies has gradually matured.
943,186-2,Long-term serial water change analysis and floods monitoring are currently research hotspots of remote sensing hydrology.
944,186-3,"However, these studies are also faced with some problems, such as coarse temporal or spatial resolution of some remote sensing data."
945,186-4,"In general, flood monitoring requires high temporal resolution, and small-scale surface water extraction requires high spatial resolution."
946,186-5,"The machine learning method has been proven to be effective against long-term serial surface water extraction, such as random forests (RFs)."
947,186-6,MODIS data are well suited for large-scale surface water dynamic analysis and flood monitoring because of its short return cycle and medium spatial resolution.
948,186-7,"In this paper, the Yangtze River Basin (YRB) in China was selected as the study area, and two MODIS products (MOD09A1 and MOD13Q1) and RF method were used to extract the surface water from 2000 to 2016."
949,186-8,"Considering the disadvantages of temporal or spatial resolution of these two MODIS products, this study also presents a data fusion method to combine them and get higher spatiotemporal resolution water results."
950,186-9,"Finally, 762 surface water maps from 2000 to 2016 are obtained, whose temporal and spatial resolution is every eight days and 250 m, respectively."
951,186-10,"In addition, water extent variation is analyzed and compared to observed precipitation data."
952,186-11,"The main conclusions are as follows: (1) this constructed approach for long-term serial surface water extraction based on the RF classifier is feasible, and a good fusion method is used to obtain the surface water body with higher spatiotemporal resolution; (2) the maximum area of the surface water extent is 48.53 x 10(3) km(2), and seasonal and permanent water areas are 20.51 x 10(3) km(2) and 28.01 x 10(3) km(2), respectively; (3) surface water area is increasing in the YRB, such that seasonal water area decreased by 3450 km(2), and the permanent water area increased by 3565 km(2) in 2001-2015; (4) precipitation is the main factor causing variation in the surface water bodies, and they both show an increasing trend in 2000-2016."
953,186-12,"As such, the approach is worth referring to other remote sensing applications, and these products are very both valuable for water resource management and flood monitoring in the study area."
954,187-1,"This paper describes a new rainfall rate retrieval algorithm, developed within the EUMETSAT H SAF program, based on the Passive microwave Neural network Precipitation Retrieval approach (PNPR v3), designed to work with the conically scanning Global Precipitation Measurement (GPM) Microwave Imager (GMI)."
955,187-2,"A new rain/no-rain classification scheme, also based on the NN approach, which provides different rainfall masks for different minimum thresholds and degree of reliability, is also described."
956,187-3,"The algorithm is trained on an extremely large observational database, built from GPM global observations between 2014 and 2016, where the NASA 2B-CMB (V04) rainfall rate product is used as reference."
957,187-4,"In order to assess the performance of PNPR v3 over the globe, an independent part of the observational database is used in a verification study."
958,187-5,"The good results found over all surface types (CC > 0.90, ME < -0.22 mm h(-1), RMSE < 2.75 mm h(-1) and FSE% < 100% for rainfall rates lower than 1 mm h(-1) and around 30-50% for moderate to high rainfall rates), demonstrate the good outcome of the input selection procedure, as well as of the training and design phase of the neural network."
959,187-6,"For further verification, two case studies over Italy are also analysed and a good consistency of PNPR v3 retrievals with simultaneous ground radar observations and with the GMI GPROF V05 estimates is found."
960,187-7,"PNPR v3 is a global rainfall retrieval algorithm, able to optimally exploit the GMI multi-channel response to different surface types and precipitation structures, that provide global rainfall retrieval in a computationally very efficient way, making the product suitable for near-real time operational applications."
961,188-1,"Due to the limitations of storage and transmission in remote sensing scenarios, lossy compression techniques have been commonly considered for remote sensing images."
962,188-2,"Inspired by the latest development in image coding techniques, we present in this paper a new compression framework, which combines the directional adaptive lifting partitioned block transform (DAL-PBT) with content-driven quadtree codec with optimized truncation (CQOT)."
963,188-3,"First, the DAL-PBT model is designed; it calculates the optimal prediction directions of each image block and performs the weighted directional adaptive interpolation during the process of directional lifting."
964,188-4,"Secondly, the CQOT method is proposed, which provides different scanning orders among and within blocks based on image content, and encodes those blocks with a quadtree codec with optimized truncation."
965,188-5,"The two phases are closely related: the former is devoted to image representation for preserving more directional information of remote sensing images, and the latter leverages adaptive scanning on the transformed image blocks to further improve coding efficiency."
966,188-6,The proposed method supports various progressive transmission modes.
967,188-7,"Experimental results show that the proposed method outperforms not only the mainstream compression methods, such as JPEG2000 and CCSDS, but also, in terms of some evaluation indexes, some state-of-the-art compression methods presented recently."

969,189-2,Automatic raft-culture monitoring by remote sensing technique is an important way to control the crop's growth and implement effective management.
970,189-3,This paper presents an automatic pixel-wise raft labeling method based on fully convolutional network (FCN).
971,189-4,"As rafts are always tiny and neatly arranged in images, traditional FCN method fails to extract the clear boundary and other detailed information."
972,189-5,"Therefore, a homogeneous convolutional neural network (HCN) is designed, which only consists of convolutions and activations to retain all details."
973,189-6,We further design a dual-scale structure (DS-HCN) to integrate higher-level contextual information for accomplishing sea-land segmentation and raft labeling at the same time in a uniform framework.
974,189-7,A dataset with Gaofen-1 satellite images was collected to verify the effectiveness of our method.

977,19-2,"One of the most elaborated and widespread algorithms, namely Fmask, was initially developed for the Landsat suite of satellites."
978,19-3,"Despite their similarity, application to Sentinel-2 imagery is currently hampered by the unavailability of a thermal band, and although results can be improved when taking the cirrus band into account, Sentinel-2 cloud detections are unsatisfactory in two points. "
979,19-4,"(1) Low altitude clouds can be undetectable in the cirrus band, and (2) bright land surfaces - especially built-up structures - are often misclassified as clouds when only considering spectral information."
980,19-5,"In this paper, we present the Cloud Displacement Index (CDI), which makes use of the three highly correlated near infrared bands that are observed with different view angles."
981,19-6,"Hence, elevated objects like clouds are observed under a parallax and can be reliably separated from bright ground objects."
982,19-7,"We compare CDI with the currently used cloud probabilities, and propose how to integrate this new functionality into the Fmask algorithm."
983,19-8,"We validate the approach using test images over metropolitan areas covering a wide variety of global environments and climates, indicating the successful separation of clouds and built-up structures (overall accuracy 95%, i.e. an improvement in overall accuracy of 0.29-0.39 compared to the previous Fmask versions over the 20 test sites), and hence a full compensation for a missing thermal band."
984,190-1,"Building extraction from remotely sensed imagery plays an important role in urban planning, disaster management, navigation, updating geographic databases, and several other geospatial applications."
985,190-2,Several published contributions dedicated to the applications of deep convolutional neural networks (DCNN) for building extraction using aerial/satellite imagery exists.
986,190-3,"However, in all these contributions, high accuracy is always obtained at the price of extremely complex and large network architectures."
987,190-4,"In this paper, we present an enhanced fully convolutional network (FCN) framework that is designed for building extraction of remotely sensed images by applying conditional random fields (CRFs)."
988,190-5,The main objective is to propose a methodology selecting a framework that balances high accuracy with low network complexity.
989,190-6,"A modern activation function, namely, the exponential linear unit (ELU), is applied to improve the performance of the fully convolutional network (FCN), thereby resulting in more accurate building prediction."
990,190-7,"To further reduce the noise (falsely classified buildings) and to sharpen the boundaries of the buildings, a post-processing conditional random fields (CRFs) is added at the end of the adopted convolutional neural network (CNN) framework."
991,190-8,The experiments were conducted on Massachusetts building aerial imagery.
992,190-9,"The results show that our proposed framework outperformed the fully convolutional network (FCN), which is the existing baseline framework for semantic segmentation, in terms of performance measures such as the F1-score and IoU measure."
993,190-10,"Additionally, the proposed method outperformed a pre-existing classifier for building extraction using the same dataset in terms of the performance measures and network complexity."
994,191-1,An accurate flood detection method is essential for obtaining areas of irrigated rice fields affected by flooding.
995,191-2,This paper aims to distinguish between rice fields with flooding and rice fields with agronomic inundation using MODerate resolution Imaging Spectroradiometer (MODIS) 8 day 500 m spatial resolution (MOD09A1) imageries over irrigated rice fields with complex cropping patterns in West Java.
996,191-3,"Over the past decade, Enhanced Vegetation Index (EVI) <= 0.1 derived from moderate resolution remote sensing imageries has been used for detecting flooding in irrigated rice fields."
997,191-4,"Without additional farming information, this paper argues that EVI <= 0.1 cannot estimate flood areas correctly, given the existence of both hazardous flooding and non-hazardous agronomic inundation in irrigated rice fields."
998,191-5,Adding a threshold of 40-day duration representing land preparation and transplanting activities enables EVI <= 0.1 to distinguish between agronomic inundation and flooding in irrigated rice fields.
999,191-6,"The difference in the Start of Season (SOS) between the wet planting season 2013/2014 and long-term average (2000-2015) shows that the Overall Accuracy (OA) and F1 scores are 75.96% and 81.74%, respectively."
1000,191-7,The confusion matrix using the respondents' reports shows OA of 80.5% and Kappa of 60.16%.
1001,191-8,"The quality of flood maps is partly influenced by environmental processes, human decisions, and mixed pixels."
1002,192-1,Stripe noise removal continues to be an active field of research for remote image processing.
1003,192-2,Most existing approaches are prone to generating artifacts in extreme areas and removing the stripe-like details.
1004,192-3,"In this paper, a weighted double sparsity unidirectional variation (WDSUV) model is constructed to reduce this phenomenon."
1005,192-4,"The WDSUV takes advantage of both the spatial domain and the gradient domain's sparse property of stripe noise, and processes the heavy stripe area, extreme area and regular noise corrupted areas using different strategies."
1006,192-5,The proposed model consists of two variation terms and two sparsity terms that can well exploit the intrinsic properties of stripe noise.
1007,192-6,"Then, the alternating direction method of multipliers (ADMM) optimal solver is employed to solve the optimization model in an alternating minimization scheme."
1008,192-7,"Compared with the state-of-the-art approaches, the experimental results on both the synthetic and real remote sensing data demonstrate that the proposed model has a better destriping performance in terms of the preservation of small details, stripe noise estimation and in the mean time for artifacts' reduction."
1009,193-1,North Sinai is of significant historical interest primarily because of its role since late prehistoric times as a land bridge between Egypt and the Levant.
1010,193-2,Access to this region is challenging due to its harsh geography and security concerns.
1011,193-3,"Remote sensing constitutes a convenient method for archaeological prospection and monitoring over such regions with its low cost (relative to ground based sensing techniques), global coverage, and high temporal and spatial sampling."
1012,193-4,This paper describes part of a study to revisit a number of sites investigated during the North Sinai Survey (1972-1982) with very high resolution optical and Synthetic Aperture Radar satellite imagery.
1013,193-5,These were acquired throughout the summer of 2017 in the framework of a European Space Agency research project.
1014,193-6,"The Synthetic Aperture Radar data includes Spotlight and Staring Spotlight modes of the TerraSAR-X mission, while the optical imagery was acquired by the Pleiades mission."
1015,193-7,The TerraSAR-X data were processed to derive filtered amplitude and consecutive coherence time series.
1016,193-8,"The results of the TerraSAR-X data processing, and the pan-sharpened Pleiades data were compared with the results of the North Sinai Survey to detect possible additional buried structures in the radar data, or newly excavated sites in the optical data."
1017,193-9,"While the analysis is still ongoing, results are reported here of the Qasrawet archaeological site, which was partially investigated by the North Sinai Survey expedition, but assumed to cover a much larger area."
1018,193-10,"Herein, a number of newly excavated structures are apparent in the remote sensing data."
1019,193-11,"The similarity of features in both the TerraSAR-X and Pleiades data suggest that all structures are surface residues, and therefore, that the subsurface mapping capabilities of the TerraSAR-X data in this area are limited."
1020,193-12,The utility of both data types for archaeological site monitoring are discussed.
1021,194-1,"Due to technical and budget limitations, there are inevitably some trade-offs in the design of remote sensing instruments, making it difficult to acquire high spatiotemporal resolution remote sensing images simultaneously."
1022,194-2,"To address this problem, this paper proposes a new data fusion model named the deep convolutional spatiotemporal fusion network (DCSTFN), which makes full use of a convolutional neural network (CNN) to derive high spatiotemporal resolution images from remotely sensed images with high temporal but low spatial resolution (HTLS) and low temporal but high spatial resolution (LTHS)."
1023,194-3,"The DCSTFN model is composed of three major parts: the expansion of the HTLS images, the extraction of high frequency components from LTHS images, and the fusion of extracted features."
1024,194-4,The inputs of the proposed network include a pair of HTLS and LTHS reference images from a single day and another HTLS image on the prediction date.
1025,194-5,"Convolution is used to extract key features from inputs, and deconvolution is employed to expand the size of HTLS images."
1026,194-6,The features extracted from HTLS and LTHS images are then fused with the aid of an equation that accounts for temporal ground coverage changes.
1027,194-7,The output image on the prediction day has the spatial resolution of LTHS and temporal resolution of HTLS.
1028,194-8,"Overall, the DCSTFN model establishes a complex but direct non-linear mapping between the inputs and the output."
1029,194-9,"Experiments with MODerate Resolution Imaging Spectroradiometer (MODIS) and Landsat Operational Land Imager (OLI) images show that the proposed CNN-based approach not only achieves state-of-the-art accuracy, but is also more robust than conventional spatiotemporal fusion algorithms."
1030,194-10,"In addition, DCSTFN is a faster and less time-consuming method to perform the data fusion with the trained network, and can potentially be applied to the bulk processing of archived data."
1031,195-1,Quantifying emissions from crop residue burning is crucial as it is a significant source of air pollution.
1032,195-2,"In this study, we first compared the fire products from two different sensors, the Visible Infrared Imaging Radiometer Suite (VIIRS) 375 m active fire product (VNP14IMG) and Moderate Resolution Imaging Spectroradiometer (MODIS) 1 km fire product (MCD14ML) in an agricultural landscape, Punjab, India."
1033,195-3,"We then performed an intercomparison of three different approaches for estimating total particulate matter (TPM) emissions which includes the fire radiative power (FRP) based approach using VIIRS and MODIS data, the Global Fire Emissions Database (GFED) burnt area emissions and a bottom-up emissions approach involving agricultural census data."
1034,195-4,Results revealed that VIIRS detected fires were higher by a factor of 4.8 compared to MODIS Aqua and Terra sensors.
1035,195-5,"Further, VIIRS detected fires were higher by a factor of 6.5 than Aqua."
1036,195-6,"The mean monthly MODIS Aqua FRP was found to be higher than the VIIRS FRP; however, the sum of FRP from VIIRS was higher than MODIS data due to the large number of fires detected by the VIIRS."
1037,195-7,"Besides, the VIIRS sum of FRP was 2.5 times more than the MODIS sum of FRP."
1038,195-8,MODIS and VIIRS monthly FRP data were found to be strongly correlated (r(2) = 0.98).
1039,195-9,"The bottom-up approach suggested TPM emissions in the range of 88.19-91.19 Gg compared to 42.0-61.71 Gg, 42.59-58.75 Gg and 93.98-111.72 Gg using the GFED, MODIS FRP, and VIIRS FRP based approaches, respectively."
1040,195-10,"Of the different approaches, VIIRS FRP TPM emissions were highest."
1041,195-11,"Since VIIRS data are only available since 2012 compared to MODIS Aqua data which have been available since May 2002, a prediction model combining MODIS and VIIRS FRP was derived to obtain potential TPM emissions from 2003-2016."
1042,195-12,"The results suggested a range of 2.56-63.66 (Gg) TPM emissions per month, with the highest crop residue emissions during November of each year."
1043,195-13,Our results on TPM emissions for seasonality matched the ground-based data from the literature.
1044,195-14,"As a mitigation option, stringent policy measures are recommended to curtail agricultural residue burning in the study area."
1045,196-1,"Infrared image segmentation plays a significant role in many burgeoning applications of remote sensing, such as environmental monitoring, traffic surveillance, air navigation and so on."
1046,196-2,"However, the precision is limited due to the blurred edge, low contrast and intensity inhomogeneity caused by infrared imaging."
1047,196-3,"To overcome these challenges, a level set method using global and local information is proposed in this paper."
1048,196-4,"In our method, a hybrid signed pressure function is constructed by fusing a global term and a local term adaptively."
1049,196-5,"The global term is represented by the global average intensity, which effectively accelerates the evolution when the evolving curve is far away from the object."
1050,196-6,"The local term is represented by a multi-feature-based signed driving force, which accurately guides the curve to approach the real boundary when it is near the object."
1051,196-7,"Then, the two terms are integrated via an adaptive weight matrix calculated based on the range value of each pixel."
1052,196-8,"Under the framework of geodesic active contour model, a new level set formula is obtained by substituting the proposed signed pressure function for the edge stopping function."
1053,196-9,"In addition, a Gaussian convolution is applied to regularize the level set function for the purpose of avoiding the computationally expensive re-initialization."
1054,196-10,"By iteration, the object of interest can be segmented when the level set function converges."
1055,196-11,Both qualitative and quantitative experiments verify that our method outperforms other state-of-the-art level set methods in terms of accuracy and robustness with the initial contour being set randomly.
1056,197-1,"Rapid, reliable, and continuous information is an essential component in disaster monitoring and management."
1057,197-2,"Remote sensing data could be a solution, but often cannot provide continuous data due to an absence of global coverage and weather and daylight dependency."
1058,197-3,"To overcome these challenges, this study makes use of weather and day/light independent Sentinel-1 data with a global coverage to monitor localized effects of different types of disasters using the Coherence Change-Detection (CCD) technique."
1059,197-4,Coherence maps were generated from Synthetic Aperture Radar (SAR) images and used to classify areas of change and no change in six study areas.
1060,197-5,"These sites are located in Syria, Puerto Rico, California, and Iran."
1061,197-6,"The study areas were divided into street blocks, and the standard deviation was calculated for the coherence images for each street block over entire image stacks."
1062,197-7,The study areas were classified by land-use type to reveal the spatial variation in coherence loss after a disaster.
1063,197-8,"While temporal decorrelation exhibits a general loss in coherence over time, disaster occurrence, however, indicates a significant loss in coherence after an event."
1064,197-9,"The variations of each street block from the average coherence for the entire image stack, as measured by a high standard deviation after a particular disaster, is an indication of disaster induced building damage."
1065,198-1,Small slope approximation (SSA) is a widely accepted approach in sea surface electromagnetic (EM) scattering studies.
1066,198-2,"Nevertheless, the spatial sample interval used for sea surface should be around or even smaller than one-eighth of the incident wavelength to ensure EM scattering calculation accuracy, which requires a huge amount of computation, creating an obstacle to scattering numerical simulation, especially for high microwave band incident waves and large sea surface scenes."
1067,198-3,"In this paper, a novel realization approach for SSA is proposed to significantly decrease the computation demands and computer memory requirements in sea surface scattering simulation."
1068,198-4,"First, the sea surface is decomposed into two scales, and each scale has its own spatial sample interval."
1069,198-5,"Then, the inclination state of the large-scale sea surface is determined under a specific wind speed."
1070,198-6,"After that, scattering calculations of a typical surface cell with a finely sampled structure are completed and saved in all possible situations."
1071,198-7,"Finally, scattering results for all the cells of a concrete sea surface are extracted from the saved cell scattering data base."
1072,198-8,"From the different kinds of scattering result comparisons, it is demonstrated that this novel SSA realization approach can attain almost similar scattering results to exact SSA."
1073,198-9,"This approach can be broadly applied in composite scattering studies, and remote sense imaging simulation of large sea surfaces with multiple targets."
1074,199-1,Evaporation (E) and transpiration (T) information is crucial for precise water resources planning and management in arid and semiarid areas.
1075,199-2,Two-source energy balance (TSEB) methods based on remotely-sensed land surface temperature provide an important modeling approach for estimating evapotranspiration (ET) and its components of E and T.
1076,199-3,Approaches for accurate decomposition of the component temperature and E/T partitioning from ET based on TSEB requires careful investigation.
1077,199-4,"In this study, three TSEB models are used: (i) the TSEB model with the Priestley-Taylor equation, i.e., TSEB-PT; (ii) the TSEB model using the Penman-Monteith equation, i.e., TSEB-PM, and (iii) the TSEB using component temperatures derived from vegetation fractional cover and land surface temperature (VFC/LST) space, i.e., TSEB-T-C-T-S."
1078,199-5,These models are employed to investigate the impact of component temperature decomposition on E/T partitioning accuracy.
1079,199-6,"Validation was conducted in the large-scale campaign of Heihe Watershed Allied Telemetry Experimental Research-Multi-Scale Observation Experiment on Evapotranspiration (HiWATER-MUSOEXE) in the northwest of China, and results showed that root mean square errors (RMSEs) of latent and sensible heat fluxes were respectively lower than 76 W/m(2) and 50 W/m(2) for all three approaches."
1080,199-7,"Based on the measurements from the stable oxygen and hydrogen isotopes system at the Daman superstation, it was found that all three models slightly overestimated the ratio of E/ET."
1081,199-8,"In addition, discrepancies in E/T partitioning among the three models were observed in the kernel experimental area of MUSOEXE."
1082,199-9,Further intercomparison indicated that different temperature decomposition methods were responsible for the observed discrepancies in E/T partitioning.
1083,199-10,The iterative procedure adopted by TSEB-PT and TSEB-PM produced higher LEC and lower T-C when compared to TSEB-T-C-T-S.
1084,199-11,"Overall, this work provides valuable insights into understanding the performances of TSEB models with different temperature decomposition mechanisms over semiarid regions."
1085,2-1,Clumping index (CI) is a measure of foliage aggregation relative to a random distribution of leaves in space.
1086,2-2,The CI can help with estimating fractions of sunlit and shaded leaves for a given leaf area index (LAI) value.
1087,2-3,Both the CI and LAI can be obtained from global Earth Observation data from sensors such as the Moderate Resolution Imaging Spectrometer (MODIS).
1088,2-4,"Here, the synergy between a MODIS-based CI and a MODIS LAI product is examined using the theory of spectral invariants, also referred to as photon recollision probability ('p-theory'), along with raw LAI-2000/2200 Plant Canopy Analyzer data from 75 sites distributed across a range of plant functional types."
1089,2-5,"The p-theory describes the probability (p-value) that a photon, having intercepted an element in the canopy, will recollide with another canopy element rather than escape the canopy."
1090,2-6,We show that empirically-based CI maps can be integrated with the MODIS LAI product.
1091,2-7,Our results indicate that it is feasible to derive approximate p-values for any location solely from Earth Observation data.
1092,2-8,This approximation is relevant for future applications of the photon recollision probability concept for global and local monitoring of vegetation using Earth Observation data.
1093,20-1,The Sentinel-2 optical satellites provide a global coverage of land surfaces with a 5-day revisit time at the Equator.
1094,20-2,We investigate the ability of these freely available optical images to detect precursory motions before rapid landslides.
1095,20-3,"A 9-month time-series of displacement is derived from Sentinel-2 data over a major landslide in the French Alps, which exhibited a sudden reactivation in June 2016."
1096,20-4,"This analysis reveals a 7-month period of low activity (<= 1 m), followed by a sudden acceleration of 3.2 +/- 1.2 m in 3 days, before the failure of a mass of about 2 to 3.6 10(6) m(3)."
1097,20-5,"The location of this precursory motion is consistent with that of the slow motions occurring since 2001 (about 1 m/year), as revealed by aerial photographs and LiDAR analysis."
1098,20-6,"This change in activity over a very short period of time (days) emphasizes the value of the frequent revisit time of Sentinel-2, despite its medium resolution of 10 m."
1099,20-7,"We finally simulate the ability of Sentinel-2 for detecting these precursory patterns before a rapid landslide occurs, based on typical Voight's laws for creeping materials, characterized by a power law exponent a."
1100,20-8,"Based on this analysis and on global cloud cover maps, we compute the probability to detect pre-failure motions of landslides using the Sentinel-2 constellation."
1101,20-9,"This probability is highly heterogeneous at the global scale, affected by the revisit time of the satellite and the cloud cover."
1102,20-10,"However the main factors controlling this detection ability are the properties of the landslide itself (its size and the alpha parameter), with almost 100% of detection probability for alpha = 1.3 and 0% for alpha = 1.8."
1103,20-11,"Despite all these limitations, probability to detect a motion before a landslide failure often reaches 50% for classical landslide parameters."
1104,20-12,These results open new perspectives for the early warning of large landslide motion from global and open source remote sensing data.
1105,200-1,Aerial scene classification is an active and challenging problem in high-resolution remote sensing imagery understanding.
1106,200-2,"Deep learning models, especially convolutional neural networks (CNNs), have achieved prominent performance in this field."
1107,200-3,The extraction of deep features from the layers of a CNN model is widely used in these CNN-based methods.
1108,200-4,"Although the CNN-based approaches have obtained great success, there is still plenty of room to further increase the classification accuracy."
1109,200-5,"As a matter of fact, the fusion with other features has great potential for leading to the better performance of aerial scene classification."
1110,200-6,"Therefore, we propose two effective architectures based on the idea of feature-level fusion."
1111,200-7,"The first architecture, i.e., texture coded two-stream deep architecture, uses the raw RGB network stream and the mapped local binary patterns (LBP) coded network stream to extract two different sets of features and fuses them using a novel deep feature fusion model."
1112,200-8,"In the second architecture, i.e., saliency coded two-stream deep architecture, we employ the saliency coded network stream as the second stream and fuse it with the raw RGB network stream using the same feature fusion model."
1113,200-9,"For sake of validation and comparison, our proposed architectures are evaluated via comprehensive experiments with three publicly available remote sensing scene datasets."
1114,200-10,"The classification accuracies of saliency coded two-stream architecture with our feature fusion model achieve 97.79%, 98.90%, 94.09%, 95.99%, 85.02%, and 87.01% on the UC-Merced dataset (50% and 80% training samples), the Aerial Image Dataset (AID) (20% and 50% training samples), and the NWPU-RESISC45 dataset (10% and 20% training samples), respectively, overwhelming state-of-the-art methods."
1115,201-1,Timely and accurate estimates of crop parameters are crucial for agriculture management.
1116,201-2,"Unmanned aerial vehicles (UAVs) carrying sophisticated cameras are very pertinent for this work because they can obtain remote-sensing images with higher temporal, spatial, and ground resolution than satellites."
1117,201-3,"In this study, we evaluated (i) the performance of crop parameters estimates using a near-surface spectroscopy (350 similar to 2500 nm, 3 nm at 700 nm, 8.5 nm at 1400 nm, 6.5 nm at 2100 nm), a UAV-mounted snapshot hyperspectral sensor (450 similar to 950 nm, 8 nm at 532 nm) and a high-definition digital camera (Visible, R, G, B); (ii) the crop surface models (CSMs), RGB-based vegetation indices (VIs), hyperspectral-based VIs, and methods combined therefrom to make multi-temporal estimates of crop parameters and to map the parameters."
1118,201-4,"The estimated leaf area index (LAI) and above-ground biomass (AGB) are obtained by using linear and exponential equations, random forest (RF) regression, and partial least squares regression (PLSR) to combine the UAV based spectral VIs and crop heights (from the CSMs)."
1119,201-5,"The results show that: (i) spectral VIs correlate strongly with LAI and AGB over single growing stages when crop height correlates positively with AGB over multiple growth stages; (ii) the correlation between the VIs multiplying crop height and AGB is greater than that between a single VI and crop height; (iii) the AGB estimate from the UAV-mounted snapshot hyperspectral sensor and high-definition digital camera is similar to the results from the ground spectrometer when using the combined methods (i.e., using VIs multiplying crop height, RF and PLSR to combine VIs and crop heights); and (iv) the spectral performance of the sensors is crucial in LAI estimates (the wheat LAI cannot be accurately estimated over multiple growing stages when using only crop height)."
1120,201-6,"The LAI estimates ranked from best to worst are ground spectrometer, UAV snapshot hyperspectral sensor, and UAV high-definition digital camera."
1121,202-1,Hyperspectral Band Selection (BS) aims to select a few informative and distinctive bands to represent the whole image cube.
1122,202-2,"In this paper, an unsupervised BS framework named the band priority index (BPI) is proposed."
1123,202-3,The basic idea of BPI is to find the bands with large amounts of information and low correlation.
1124,202-4,"Sequential forward search (SFS) is used to avoid an exhaustive search, and the objective function of BPI consist of two parts: the information metric and the correlation metric."
1125,202-5,"We proposed a new band correlation metric, namely, the joint correlation coefficient (JCC), to estimate the joint correlation between a single band and multiple bands."
1126,202-6,JCC uses the angle between a band and the hyperplane determined by a band set to evaluate the correlation between them.
1127,202-7,"To estimate the amount of information, the variance and entropy are used as the information metric for BPI, respectively."
1128,202-8,"Since BPI is a framework for BS, other information metrics and different mathematic functions of the angle can also be used in the model, which means there are various implementations of BPI."
1129,202-9,The BPI-based methods have the advantages as follows: (1) The selected bands are informative and distinctive. (2) The BPI-based methods usually have good computational efficiencies. (3) These methods have the potential to determine the number of bands to be selected.
1130,202-10,The experimental results on different real hyperspectral datasets demonstrate that the BPI-based methods are highly efficient and accurate BS methods.
1131,203-1,Aircraft type recognition plays an important role in remote sensing image interpretation.
1132,203-2,"Traditional methods suffer from bad generalization performance, while deep learning methods require large amounts of data with type labels, which are quite expensive and time-consuming to obtain."
1133,203-3,"To overcome the aforementioned problems, in this paper, we propose an aircraft type recognition framework based on conditional generative adversarial networks (GANs)."
1134,203-4,"First, we design a new method to precisely detect aircrafts' keypoints, which are used to generate aircraft masks and locate the positions of the aircrafts."
1135,203-5,"Second, a conditional GAN with a region of interest (ROI)-weighted loss function is trained on unlabeled aircraft images and their corresponding masks."
1136,203-6,"Third, an ROI feature extraction method is carefully designed to extract multi-scale features from the GAN in the regions of aircrafts."
1137,203-7,"After that, a linear support vector machine (SVM) classifier is adopted to classify each sample using their features."
1138,203-8,"Benefiting from the GAN, we can learn features which are strong enough to represent aircrafts based on a large unlabeled dataset."
1139,203-9,"Additionally, the ROI-weighted loss function and the ROI feature extraction method make the features more related to the aircrafts rather than the background, which improves the quality of features and increases the recognition accuracy significantly."
1140,203-10,"Thorough experiments were conducted on a challenging dataset, and the results prove the effectiveness of the proposed aircraft type recognition framework."
1141,204-1,"Glaciers in the Tibetan Plateau (TP) play a crucial role in regulating agriculture irrigation, river discharge and the regional/global climate system."
1142,204-2,"However, mass balance records of TP glaciers have remained scarce due to challenging mountainous terrain and harsh weather conditions, which limits our understanding of the influence of melting glaciers on local water resources and responses to climate change."
1143,204-3,"Here, we present and assess an albedo-based method to derive annual mass balance for three glaciers in the interior TP from Moderate Resolution Imaging Spectroradiometer (MODIS) albedo data during 2000-2016."
1144,204-4,"A strong linear correlation (R-2 = 0.941, P < 0.001) is found between annual minimum-averaged glacier-wide albedo (AMGA) values and annual mass balance measurements on the Xiao Dongkemadi glacier."
1145,204-5,"Furthermore, the 17-year-long annual mass balance series of the Xiao Dongkemadi glacier and the Geladandong mountain region glaciers, and the Purogangri ice cap are reconstructed for the first time, with a mass loss rate of 535 +/- 63 mm w.e.a(-1), 243 +/- 66 mm w.e.a(-1) and 113 +/- 68 mm w.e.a(-1), respectively."
1146,204-6,"The results are verified by geodetic estimates, with relative error ranging from 4.55% to 11.80%, confirming that the albedo-based method can be used to estimate specific mass budgets for interior TP glaciers."
1147,204-7,A strong correlation between the mass balance series and air temperature infers that increasing summer air temperature may be one of main reasons for glacier shrinkage of the three studied glaciers.
1148,205-1,"The microwave scatterometer is one of the most effective instruments in ocean remote sensing, which urges the need for some theoretical models to accurately estimate the scattering coefficient of the sea surface."
1149,205-2,"For the simulation of the scattering from an ocean surface, the sea spectrum, or its inverse Fourier transform, autocorrelation function is essential."
1150,205-3,"Currently, many sea spectral models have been proposed for describing sea waves."
1151,205-4,"However, which spectrum should be adopted during electromagnetic (EM) computations?"
1152,205-5,A systematic comparison of these models is needed to evaluate their accuracies.
1153,205-6,"In this paper, we focus on numerical simulations of scattering from a rough sea surface in monostatic and bistatic configurations by using six different sea spectral models and the first-order small slope approximation (SSA-1)."
1154,205-7,"First, sea spectral models proposed by Elfouhaily et al., Hwang et al., Romeiser et al., Apel et al., Fung et al., and Pierson et al., are compared with each other from different points of view, e.g., the omnidirectional parts, the angular spreading functions, the autocorrelation functions, and the slope variances."
1155,205-8,We find that the spectra given by Elfouhaily and Hwang could reflect realistic wind sea waves more accurately.
1156,205-9,"Then, the scattering coefficients are simulated in fully monostatic and bistatic configurations."
1157,205-10,"Regarding the monostatic scattering, the results simulated using EM scattering models are compared with those obtained from the measured UAVSAR data in the L band and the empirical model CMOD5 in the C band."
1158,205-11,"Comparisons are made for various incident angles, wind speeds, and wind directions."
1159,205-12,"Meanwhile, special attention is paid to low to moderate incident angles."
1160,205-13,"The comparisons show that, it is difficult to find one certain spectral model to simulate scattering coefficient accurately under all wind speeds or wind directions."
1161,205-14,Accurate estimations will be obtained using different methods according to different situations.
1162,206-1,"Characterized by high concentrations and significant diurnal dynamics, total suspended particulate matter (TSM) in Hangzhou Bay (HZB) can influence the water quality."
1163,206-2,Both cruise sampling and polar-orbiting satellite remote sensing make it difficult to synoptically delineate such matter in coastal regions due to insufficient spatiotemporal resolution.
1164,206-3,"However, near-real-time monitoring from the Geostationary Ocean Color Imager (GOCI), the world's first geostationary satellite ocean color sensor, now allows hourly observations of target areas."
1165,206-4,"Here, we developed an empirical TSM retrieval algorithm for the GOCI, based on the spectral absorption index (SAI)."
1166,206-5,"Additionally, validations of the atmospheric correction algorithm and SAI TSM algorithm were conducted, with the GOCI-retrieved normalized water-leaving radiance (Lwn) and TSM well-matched with in situ values."
1167,206-6,"Moreover, the diurnal dynamics corresponded to tidal phases, with a maximum-of 5000 mg/L in central HZB."
1168,206-7,"The seasonal variations in TSM were also determined by freshwater inputs and sediment loads, with correlation coefficients of -0.77 and 0.84, respectively."
1169,206-8,"The increased wind speed in winter enhanced vertical mixing and favored the resuspension of sediment to the upper layer, and therefore TSM was higher in winter than in summer."
1170,206-9,These results highlight the feasibility of using geostationary ocean color remote sensing to monitor short-term and regional oceanic phenomena in coastal waters.
1171,206-10,"Furthermore, this study contributes to our understanding of related sediment dynamics and physical biogeochemical processes."
1172,207-1,This study focuses on tracing the error sources of the latest global satellite mapping of precipitation for global precipitation measurement (GPM-GSMaP) over the Tibetan Plateau by the corresponding satellite information flag provided by the retrieval system.
1173,207-2,"We investigated the characteristics of GPM-GSMaP estimates from 11 passive microwave sensors (including 7 imagers and 4 sounders) and 1 geo-infrared data source integrating the morphing technique (i.e., morph)."
1174,207-3,Assessment results show that imagers are generally superior to sounders and morph.
1175,207-4,"Among the seven types of imagers, the Tropical Rainfall Measuring Mission Microwave Imager, which rarely underestimates heavy rain events, exhibits the best performance with total bias of -8.8%."
1176,207-5,"In contrast, the worst performance is found in the special sensor microwave imager/sounder on defense meteorological satellite program (DMSP)-F19 with the largest bias of approximately 39.8%."
1177,207-6,"The GPM Microwave Imager shows acceptable accuracy in detecting heavy rain, but it tends to overestimate light and moderate rain."
1178,207-7,"Compared to the imagers, all the sounders produced larger biases (>120%), although they show lower probability of missing rainfall events."
1179,207-8,"Particularly, the AMSU-A/MHS(i.e., Advanced Microwave Sounding Unit-A; Microwave Humidity Sounder) on national oceanic and atmospheric administration (NOAA) satellites (i.e., NOAA-18 and -19) display higher biases than those on meteorological operational satellite (MetOp) satellites (i.e., MetOp-A and -B), with dramatic overestimation up to 168.4%."
1180,207-9,"Additionally, the error components of morph show a similar pattern to those of sounders, except for substantial underestimation of heavy rain events."
1181,207-10,The approach of tracing error reported here can enable both GPM-GSMaP users and developers to better understand the error sources of precipitation retrievals.
1182,208-1,Remote sensing is an indispensable tool for Earth observation over large areal extent.
1183,208-2,Snow cover extent monitoring has been one such application where microwave sensors have been a popular choice due to their sensitivity toward the dielectric property.
1184,208-3,Snow is a dynamic matter since its dielectric state is dependent on climatic factors prevailing locally around it.
1185,208-4,"In the literature, the polarization fraction (PF) has been used for landcover characterization."
1186,208-5,"In this paper, we utilize the seasonal variation of the PF for mapping snow cover over the Himalayan terrain."
1187,208-6,Temporal variation of the strength in the polarized return due to change in landcover and season is the prime motivation behind this approach.
1188,208-7,"In addition, the effect of SAR data acquisition time on mapping algorithms is considered in this work which is seldom discussed in the literature."
1189,208-8,"Furthermore, a study is conducted to analyze the seasonal variation in the entropy (H) and the scattering type (a) parameters over the bare snow-covered ground and the forested areas."
1190,208-9,The seasonal response of the terrain in the H/a plane corresponding to specific scattering characteristics is analyzed.
1191,208-10,"The applicability of the approach is tested with RADARSAT-2 (FQ28) C-band full polarimetric image pairs over the Manali-Dhundi region, Himachal Pradesh, India, located in the western Hindu-Kush Himalayas."
1192,208-11,The snow cover map is explicitly validated with in situ observatory measurements and optical satellite imagery.
1193,209-1,Satellite remote sensing provides new insight into the large-scale changes within the Arctic sea ice cover.
1194,209-2,"In this study, satellite-derived sea ice parameters (thickness and age) were explored to investigate age-dependent Arctic sea ice volume changes."
1195,209-3,"Between 2003-2008 (ICESat) and 2011-2015 (CyroSat-2), Arctic Ocean sea ice experienced a net depletion of roughly 4.68 x 10(3) km(3) during autumn (October-November) and about 87% (or 4.11 x 10(3) km(3)) is caused by the removal in multiyear ice (two years and older)."
1196,209-4,"In spring (February-March), the net ice depletion amounts to 1.46 x 10(3) km(3), with the multiyear ice loss of 3.74 x 10(3) km(3) and seasonal ice increment of 2.24 x 10(3) km(3)."
1197,209-5,"Among multiyear ice loss, about 74% (autumn) and 93% (spring) of the loss were attributable to the depletion of the oldest ice type (5 years and older)."
1198,209-6,"Analyses also affirm that the marvelous volume loss of multiyear ice during cold months (October-May) in 2006/2007 and 2011/2012, along with the low replenishment of perennial ice as noted in the following autumns in 2007 and 2012, plays a major role in leading to a younger Arctic sea ice cover."
1199,209-7,"Consequently, these processes together favors for the overall substantial volume loss observed in the Arctic sea ice cover."
1200,21-1,Remote sensing studies of vegetation phenology increasingly benefit from freely available satellite imagery acquired with high temporal frequency at fine spatial resolution.
1201,21-2,"Particularly for heterogeneous landscapes this is good news, given the drawback of medium-resolution sensors commonly used for phenology retrieval (e.g., MODIS) to properly represent the fine-scale spatial variability of vegetation types."
1202,21-3,The Sentinel-2 mission acquires spectral data globally at 10 to 60 m resolution every five days.
1203,21-4,"To illustrate the mission's potential for studying vegetation phenology, we retrieved phenological parameters for the Dutch barrier island Schiermonnikoog for a full season of Sentinel-2A observations in 2016."
1204,21-5,"Overlapping orbits resulted in two acquisitions per 10 days, similar to what is achieved globally since the launch of Sentinel-2B."
1205,21-6,For eight locations on the island's salt marsh we compared greenness chromatic coordinate (GCC) series derived from digital repeat RGB-cameras with vegetation index series derived from Sentinel-2 (NDVI and GCC).
1206,21-7,"For each series, a double hyperbolic tangent model was fitted and thresholds were applied to the modelled data to estimate start-, peak-, and end-of-season (SOS/PS/EOS)."
1207,21-8,"Variability in Sentinel-2 derived SOS, when taken as the midpoint between minimum and peak NDVI, was well-explained by camera GCC-based SOS (R-2 = 0.74, MSD = 8.0 days, RMSD = 13.0 days)."
1208,21-9,"However, EOS estimates from camera GCC series were on average almost two months before NDVI-based estimates."
1209,21-10,"This could partially be explained by the observed exponential relationship between GCC and NDVI, as well as by the combined effect of viewing angle differences and the presence of nonphotosynthetic elements in the vegetation canopy."
1210,21-11,A two-layer canopy radiative transfer model incorporating reduced chlorophyll levels in the upper layer provided a physically-based explanation of the viewing angle effect.
1211,21-12,"Finally, we applied the phenology retrieval approach to NDVI series for all pixels of the island in order to map spatial patterns of phenology at fine resolution."
1212,21-13,Our results demonstrate the potential of the Sentinel-2 mission for providing spatially-detailed retrievals of phenology.
1213,210-1,"Individual tree crown detection and delineation (ITCD) mainly depend on high-resolution aerial photos and satellite images or LiDAR, and these data can be costly to obtain."
1214,210-2,The advent of unmanned aerial vehicle (UAV) remote sensing technology provides an economic and effective method for data acquisition.
1215,210-3,"Therefore, the research of ITCD based on UAV high-resolution images is of significance to improve the efficiency and accuracy of forest resource inventory and remote sensing validation."
1216,210-4,"However, in very high-resolution (defined here with the pixel size smaller than 10 cm) images, the inhomogeneities in the canopy texture can be detrimental to the correct detection of individual trees by computer processing."
1217,210-5,"We applied the bias field estimation, which is used in medical image segmentation, to reduce the within-canopy spectral heterogeneity in the very high-resolution UAV-derived orthophoto."
1218,210-6,"By selecting young Osmanthus and Podocarpus trees that grow in a nursery as the study objects, we tested our method in an orthophoto (with a ground resolution of 2.5 cm) generated from overlapping UAV images."
1219,210-7,"A local intensity clustering was first applied to produce a smoothed bias field image; then, by using morphological operation of opening and closing, the fine texture of the canopy was further smoothed."
1220,210-8,"Finally, individual tree crowns were extracted by applying the marker-controlled watershed segmentation algorithm."
1221,210-9,The segmentation results were validated by comparing to the manually drawn individual tree crown polygons.
1222,210-10,"The F-scores of the detection rate for Osmanthus and Podocarpus were 98.2% and 93.1%, respectively."
1223,210-11,The result is considerably better than those achieved with similar processing steps but without the bias field treatment.
1224,210-12,Our study proves that it is feasible and effective to detect and delineate individual tree crowns based on the bias field and marker-controlled watershed segmentation in very-high-resolution images obtained from UAV.
1225,211-1,Mapping plants traits on theQinghai-Tibetan Plateau grassland is important for understanding ecosystem functions and how plants respond to global change.
1226,211-2,Detailed trait maps for the complete Qinghai-Tibetan Plateau are missing.
1227,211-3,"Here, we addressed this issue by combining Sentinel-2 and Landsat-8 multispectral satellite data with field measurements to map and compare plant traits of meadow and steppe communities across the complete Qinghai-Tibetan Plateau."
1228,211-4,"We measured in-situ plant-level traits of CHLorophyll content (CHL), specific plant area (SPA = plant area / plant dry mass), and plant dry matter content (PDMC = plant dry mass / fresh mass)."
1229,211-5,We hypothesized that plant-level traits of SPA and PDMC are close to community-weighted means (CWMs) of specific leaf area (SLA) and leaf dry matter content (LDMC) because leaves represent the largest fraction of above-ground biomass in the Qinghai-Tibetan Plateau grasslands.
1230,211-6,"Despite vastly different measurement methods, we found that the remotely sensed traits (SPA and PDMC) correlated with literature-derived leaf traits of CWMs of SLA and LDMC."
1231,211-7,Both remotely sensed and field-measured results showed that alpine meadow plants reveal a wider range and higher averages of CHL and SPA but lower PDMC compared with alpine steppe plants.
1232,211-8,"These trait differences between vegetation types indicate faster growth of alpine meadow and higher resilience to harsh conditions of alpine steppe, representing differences in adaptation strategies to environmental conditions."
1233,211-9,Our study demonstrates that remote sensing can be used to estimate plant traits in alpine grasslands with potential applications to retrieve functional diversity and correlated ecosystem functions in future studies.
1234,212-1,"Commonly used destriping techniques in remote sensing applications have underlying Fourier transform process which tends to alter heavily the digital number values of surface features; thus, impacting its subsequent use in any image classification scheme."
1235,212-2,"In this paper, we develop a novel destriping technique in the wavelet domain where statistical measures namely, standard deviation, signal-to-noise ratio, and entropy of the image and stripes are integrated in the wavelet filter design."
1236,212-3,"Wavelet transform essentially keeps spatial information of the stripes in the transformed domain; thus, allowing a wavelet to filter stripes at different scales with minimal effect on image pixels relating to the surface features."
1237,212-4,"We further propose a novel s for an environmental application, where a destriped band in the wavelet domain is included in image classification for forest encroachment mapping."
1238,212-5,"The technique is implemented on IRS-1D LISS-III data for the mapping of forest encroachment in the Andaman and Nicobar Island, India, wherein the short wave infrared (SWIR) band is destriped and included in the image classification based on the linear support vector machine method."
1239,212-6,"Statistical accuracy in terms of Kappa values for the resultant classified images by 1) including striped SWIR, 2) excluding SWIR, and 3) using destriped SWIR band are 0.97, 0.98, and 1, respectively."
1240,212-7,Z-tests indicate that the thematic map with destriped SWIR band is statistically significantly better than the other two maps.
1241,213-1,"Estimating the carbon stock of forests, and further studying their spatiotemporal variations is an important prerequisite for assessing forest carbon sequestration capability."
1242,213-2,"This paper simulated aboveground carbon (AGC) of bamboo forest in Zhejiang Province, China, during 2003-2014 based on the combination of an improved BIOME-BGC (BioGeochemical Cycles) model and bamboo forest map extracted from moderate resolution imaging spectroradiometer data, and analyzed the characteristic and impact factors of the AGC spatiotemporal variations based on the geostatistical method."
1243,213-3,"The modeled AGC density significantly correlated with the plot data from continuous forest resource inventory, and led to an average correlation coefficient and normalized root mean square error (NRMSE) of 0.81% and 17.15%, respectively."
1244,213-4,"The stands with high AGC density were distributed in the mountainous areas in the northwest, southwest, and northeast of the province, while those with low AGC density were located in the basin, high altitude areas, and coastal areas."
1245,213-5,"During the study period, the AGC density and total AGC storage increased from 12.02 to 18.15 Mg C ha(-1) and 9.22 to 16.41 Tg, respectively."
1246,213-6,"The spatial heterogeneity of AGC was revealed by an exponential semi-variance model, and characterized by significant autocorrelation."
1247,213-7,"The dominant factors contributing to the spatial heterogeneity of AGC were structure relevant factors, especially meteorological and terrain factors."
1248,213-8,"The autocorrelation range of AGC in 2003 was 24.90 km, but decreased dramatically after that, indicating that the influence of external factors (i.e., management measures) on AGC increased gradually."
1249,214-1,We implemented a change detection method based on a multitemporal object using a chi-square method and iterative trimming to find the changed object in the past.
1250,214-2,"Trapping in the sample data does not obey Gaussian distribution, and the detection result is not ideal."
1251,214-3,"To fix this problem, we proposed a method based on the law of cosines with a box-whisker plot."
1252,214-4,"First, using the incremental segmentation method to segment the image and selecting the optimum combination of spatial, spectral, and contextual features by the Optimum Index Factor method, we constructed the feature space of different time images."
1253,214-5,"Then, the law of cosines was used to calculate the change index of every object."
1254,214-6,"Finally, we identified changed objects by analyzing the change index using the box-whisker plot."
1255,214-7,High-resolution remote sensing images of GF-1 were used as the experimental data.
1256,214-8,The experimental results show that the correct detection accuracy and omissions rate accuracy are much better than the results of the traditional multitemporal-object-based change detection.
1257,215-1,"Remote sensing image pan sharpening has attracted researchers' interest, since spatial resolution of multispectral (MS) image can be enhanced by injecting spatial details of a panchromatic image to MS image."
1258,215-2,"In this paper, a novel sparse representation based pan sharpening method is proposed to overcome the disadvantages of traditional methods such as color distortion and blurring effect."
1259,215-3,This learning based method utilizes a compact single dictionary generated from texture information of high-resolution MS images in order to provide more effective and robust pan sharpening.
1260,215-4,Two data sets acquired from IKONOS and Quick-bird satellites are used to evaluate the performance and robustness of the proposed algorithm.
1261,215-5,The proposed method is compared with nine well-known component substitution and multiresolution analysis methods and a state-of-art method using several quality measurement indices with references.
1262,215-6,"The experimental results demonstrate that the proposed algorithm is competitive or superior to other conventional methods in terms of visual and quantitative analysis, as it preserves spectral information and provides high quality spatial details in the final product image."
1263,216-1,"Multiscale image segmentation is a fundamental process of object-based image analysis, and the segmentation scale is a key parameter."
1264,216-2,"The selection of the optimal scale parameter has attracted widely attentions in recent years, and many methods were proposed for this task."
1265,216-3,"However, these methods usually need to set a scale sequence, which depends on the segmentation algorithm."
1266,216-4,"When using another segmentation algorithm, the definition of the scale is different, these methods are less effective."
1267,216-5,"In this study, we are aiming at developing a general framework for analyzing and estimating the optimal scale parameter for the region-merging segmentation, which is the most widely used approach for generating multiscale objects in remote sensing."
1268,216-6,A stepwise evolution analysis (SEA) framework and its application in optimal scale parameter estimation are proposed.
1269,216-7,"In the SEA framework, the evolutions of scale, local variance (LV), and Moran's I (MI) indexes are analyzed step-by-step, and then, be used for automated scale parameterizations."
1270,216-8,"Four LV-and MI-metrics-based methods were technically integrated in this framework, and applied to a Quick-Bird and a WorldView-2 image to evaluate the performance."
1271,216-9,"The results demonstrated that: The stepwise analysis of a hierarchical region merging provided the distribution information of the scale, which could be used to estimate the key parameters and integrate different scale parameterization methods."
1272,216-10,"The traditional LV-and MI-based scale estimation methods could be technically integrated, which showed the powerful ability and great potential in utilizing different scale parameterization methods for the region-merging segmentation."
1273,217-1,This paper presents a novel content-based remote sensing (RS) image retrieval system that consists of the following.
1274,217-2,"First, an image description method that characterizes both spatial and spectral information content of RS images."
1275,217-3,"Second, a supervised retrieval method that efficiently models and exploits the sparsity of RS image descriptors."
1276,217-4,"The proposed image description method characterizes the spectral content by three different novel spectral descriptors that are: raw pixel values, simple bag of spectral values and the extended bag of spectral values descriptors."
1277,217-5,"To model the spatial content of RS images, we consider the well-known scale invariant feature transform-based bag of visual words approach."
1278,217-6,"With the conjunction of the spatial and the spectral descriptors, RS image retrieval is achieved by a novel sparse reconstruction-based RS image retrieval method."
1279,217-7,The proposed method considers a novel measure of label likelihood in the framework of sparse reconstruction-based classifiers and generalizes the original sparse classifier to the case both single-label and multi-label RS image retrieval problems.
1280,217-8,"Finally, to enhance retrieval performance, we introduce a strategy to exploit the sensitivity of the sparse reconstruction-based method to different dictionary words."
1281,217-9,Experimental results obtained on two benchmark archives show the effectiveness of the proposed system.

1284,218-3,"Based on the MODIS thermal infrared remotely sensed data, the split-window algorithm was used to retrieve the surface temperature of the geothermal region in Eastern Liaoning, China."
1285,218-4,"The temperature inversion images at four seasons during the year of 2016 were selected, and the high temperature zones in the inversion results were compared with the geothermal features and fault structures in the study area."
1286,218-5,It was found that the spatial distribution relationships were highly similar.
1287,218-6,"In conclusion, the distribution of geothermal resources can be inferred by analyzing the inversion results of regional temperatures and geological structures."
1288,219-1,Ocean Heat Content (OHC) and Ocean Mean temperature (OMT) products at seven different depths between 50 and 700 m along with Tropical Cyclone Heat Potential (TCHP) are hosted at Bhuvan website of National Remote Sensing Centre (NRSC) for activities carried out under the National Information System for Climate and Environment Studies (NICES) program.
1289,219-2,These products are generated using Sea Surface Temperature (SST) and Sea Surface Height Anomaly (SSHA) over the north Indian Ocean between 40-120A degrees E and 0-30A degrees N on daily basis.
1290,219-3,These products have been generated till the availability of Tropical Rainfall Monitoring Mission Microwave Imager (TMI) SST.
1291,219-4,"Since TMI SST is no longer available beyond April 2015, Advanced Microwave Scanning Radiometer 2 (AMSR2) derived SST is considered to continue generation of the OHC and related products."
1292,219-5,"The AMSR2 derived products are found well related with TMI based estimations (R-2 > 0.99) at all the depth levels of 50, 100, 150, 200, 300, 500, and 700 m depth."
1293,219-6,We have also observed a good relationship for TCHP and OMT products.
1294,219-7,The maximum Root Mean Square Error of 7.9 kJ/cm(2) for OHC at 700 m depth and low scatter index (< 0.005) indicate good quality of OHC products generated with AMSR2 based SST.
1295,22-1,"With the rapid development of remote sensing technology, how to accurately detect changes that have occurred on the land surface has been a critical task, particularly when images come from different satellite sensors."
1296,22-2,"In this letter, we propose an unsupervised change detection method for heterogeneous synthetic aperture radar (SAR) and optical images based on the logarithmic transformation feature learning framework."
1297,22-3,"First, the logarithmic transformation is applied to the SAR image that aims to achieve similar statistical distribution properties as the optical image."
1298,22-4,"Then, high-level feature representations can be learned from the transformed image pair via joint feature extraction, which are used to select reliable samples for training a neural network classifier."
1299,22-5,"When it is trained well, a robust change map can be obtained, thus identifying changed regions accurately."
1300,22-6,The experimental results on three real heterogeneous data sets demonstrate the effectiveness and superiority of the proposed method compared with other existing state-of-the-art approaches.

1302,220-2,"For convenience and efficiency, such applications are integrated in a Geographical Information System (GIS) (Bendouda and Berrached, in Etude et r,alisation d'UREGIS un SIG pour la gestion du r,seau routier urbain, Magister Thesis, University of Sciences and Technology of Oran Algeria 2009)."
1303,220-3,GIS Map needs real time automatic updating and revisions of the road network databases.
1304,220-4,"However, due to the extreme complexity of the urban environment, there are currently many methods involving the extraction of roads by means of automatic or semi-automatic approaches in rural and sub-urban areas; but in urban environment the majority of these methods failed, due to the complexity of this environment and the complex appearance of the road in the remotely sensed image."
1305,220-5,"In this paper, we introduce a new approach to extract road network in urban area from low resolution satellite images."
1306,220-6,"The proposed method is a modified version of the dynamic programming method for semi-automatic extraction of road network, based on the F* algorithm."
1307,220-7,The preliminary step is the seeding of points belonging to roads.
1308,220-8,F* detects the segments that may belong to a road by optimizing certain criteria.
1309,220-9,"Given the complexity of urban areas and the existence of different road categories, we propose an improved version of the classical algorithm F* called PR-F*(Parallel Research-F*)."
1310,220-10,It detects the road segments automatically in many directions.
1311,220-11,The obtained results are evaluated in terms of quality with respect to completeness and correctness.
1312,221-1,The Central Gold Belt (CGB) of Malaysia is a major host to gold deposits.
1313,221-2,"Penjom, Raub, Selising and Buffalo reef are major gold mines in CGB."
1314,221-3,"The study area, Selinsing gold mine, is located at the northwest of Pahang province on the lineament known as the Raub Bentong Suture."
1315,221-4,Presence of dense vegetation and cloud cover in tropical regions are main obstacles in alteration mapping using satellite imageries.
1316,221-5,"In this study, Landsat 8 and ASTER level 1B images were used to map clay minerals and quartz rich zones at Selinsing gold mine and surrounding areas."
1317,221-6,"Direct principal component analysis (DPCA), matched filtering (MF) and band ratio were the effective methods used in this study."
1318,221-7,"High concentration of clay minerals was detected using band ratio 6/7, DPC2 and MF and ratio 14/12 was carried out to highlight quartz rich zones."
1319,221-8,The results of image processing methods were verified by in situ inspection and X-ray diffraction analyses.
1320,221-9,"The results show that, in spite of limited bedrock exposure, the known gold prospects and potential areas of mineralization can be recognized by the methods employed in this study."
1321,222-1,Poverty has emerged as one of the chronic dilemmas facing the development of human society during the twenty first century.
1322,222-2,Accurately identifying regions of poverty could lead to more effective poverty-alleviation programs.
1323,222-3,"This study used a new type of remote-sensing data, NPP-VIIRS, to locate poverty-stricken areas based on nighttime light, taking Chongqing Municipality as a sample, and constructed a multidimensional poverty index (MPI) system, guided by a well-known and widely used conceptual framework of sustainable livelihood."
1324,222-4,A regression model was constructed and results were correlated with those using the average nighttime light index.
1325,222-5,"The model was then tested on Shaanxi Province, and average relative error of the estimated MPI was only 11.12%."
1326,222-6,These results showed that multidimensional poverty had a high spatial concentration effect at the regional scale.
1327,222-7,"We then applied the index nationwide, at the county scale, analyzing 2852 counties, which we divided into seven classifications, based on the MPI: extremely low, low, relatively low, medium, relatively high, high, and extremely high."
1328,222-8,Eight hundred forty-eight counties in 26 provinces were identified as multidimensionally poor.
1329,222-9,"Among these, 254 were absolutely poor counties and 543 were relatively poor counties; 195 of these are not on the list of poverty-stricken counties as identified by income levels alone."
1330,222-10,"By improving the accuracy of targeting, this method of identifying multidimensional poverty areas could help the Chinese government improve the effectiveness of poverty reduction strategies, and it could also be used as a reference for other countries or regions that seek to target poor areas that suffer multidimensional deprivation."
1331,223-1,"There is an urgent need for zoning the dust sources, as the first step to control dust storms."
1332,223-2,"Hence, this study aimed to identify the exact interior sources of dust in Khuzestan Province (Iran), using a hybrid method of remote sensing, GIS and sedimentology."
1333,223-3,"To this end, the spatial data of pedology, landuse, climate, slope and sedimentology were used as the constraint layers and vegetation, land surface temperature and soil moisture were used as the major layers."
1334,223-4,The major layers were extracted by performing the necessary computational process on the image of the Landsat 8 satellite.
1335,223-5,Constraint layers were used to eliminate the regions without dust production potential.
1336,223-6,"In the next step, the major layers were weighted applying the paired comparison and fuzzy analytic hierarchy process methods."
1337,223-7,"Then, the final integration of the layers took place by multiplying each major layer in the respective weight, and the map of the dust sources in the region was prepared."
1338,223-8,"To validate the results, field trips were done for 180 points of the sources which indicate the high accuracy of the identified regions."
1339,223-9,"The results revealed that 9% of the area in Khuzestan Plain equal to 350,000 ha is regarded as the source of dust production."
1340,223-10,"Moreover, according to the results, it can be said that satellite images, especially those with efficient resolutions such as Landsat 8 products, are suitable basis data for extracting indicators (temperature, humidity and vegetation) of the dust sources."
1341,224-1,"Comparative examination of Survey of India Topographical Map sheets of 1972-1973 survey and satellite data of 1999, 2006, 2007, 2008 and 2017 period has revealed that the niche point of Ganga river has shifted about 2.9 km upstream (westward) from immediate west of Faizullahpur (in 1973) to the south of Rangpura (by 2017)."
1342,224-2,The sectoral migration of the Ganga channel in Jahangirwa-Phaphamau-Faizullahpur-Jhusi sector has been characterised by oscillations and conspicuous westerly shift in Phaphamau-Faizullahpur segment.
1343,224-3,The channel oscillation has been very pronounced between 2008 and 2017.
1344,224-4,The relict channels in the immediate west (upstream) of Phaphamau bridge are evidences of the new pathway carved out by Ganga River during the recent years and may again serve as easy pathways for flood waters during heavy precipitation in the catchment area of the river.
1345,224-5,Digital Elevation Model of the study area highlights the conspicuous oscillations (of Ganga River) and consequent successive migration within the river valley.
1346,224-6,The oscillatory migration of the Ganga channel makes its future path very unpredictable and this is turn poses potential risk not only to both the northern and southern bank abutments (of the Phaphamau bridge) but also to the northern and eastern parts of the holy city of Allahabad.
1347,224-7,In view of this additional protection work is required in the upstream of Phaphamau bridge and also in Phaphamau-Jhusi stretch in the downstream.
1348,225-1,Through-the-wall radar imaging is a research area which has gathered renewed interest with the development of powerful millimeter-wave sources and detectors.
1349,225-2,Imaging techniques that require some sort of reconstruction can suffer from slow speeds and lack of complexity in the data acquisition phase of the measurements.
1350,225-3,These reconstruction methods can be greatly improved using compressive sensing (CS)-based tools that increase speed during these processes.
1351,225-4,"Here, a %V-band single-pixel imaging system based on CS, which utilizes a mechanically controlled spatial light modulator to rapidly acquire the image, is demonstrated for metallic targets placed behind drywall."
1352,225-5,The system uses a frequency-modulated continuous wave W-band transmitter to illuminate the wall and the target.
1353,225-6,The image reflected off the target's field of view is spatially modulated by 10 x 10 array patterned masks and the signals are collected through a heterodyne receiver.
1354,225-7,"The system can differentiate and locate a behind-the-wall object through the frequency swept Michelson interferometry analysis, since the strong reflections from the surface of the wall and the object induce an interference effect, which is observed at the receiver."
1355,225-8,The overall design of the optical system is optimized with respect to the geometry of the modulation pattern in the image plane resulting in successfully reconstructed images of objects using CS-based algorithms.
1356,225-9,"Using larger optics and uniquely patterned masks such techniques can provide the solutions toward cast-effective, rapid analysis of structural changes in or behind visibly opaque media."
1357,226-1,Land cover classification using polarimetric synthetic aperture radar (PolSAR) images is an important tool for remote sensing analysis.
1358,226-2,"In view that PolSAR image effective interpretation is commonly affected by the absence of discriminative features and the presence of speckle noises, this letter proposes an adaptive nonlocal stacked sparse autoencoder (ANSSAE) to achieve PolSAR image classification."
1359,226-3,"It extracts the adaptive nonlocal spatial information by adaptively calculating weighted average values of each pixel from nonlocal regions, which can reduce the influence of speckle noises and retain edge details."
1360,226-4,"In the first layer of the ANSSAE, the adaptive nonlocal spatial information is introduced into the objective function to obtain the robust feature representation, whose effects would transfer to the rest of layers."
1361,226-5,"Therefore, the ANSSAE can automatically capture spatial-related, robust, and distinguishable features, which can suppress speckle noises and gain accurate classification results."
1362,226-6,Experimental results on two real PolSAR images demonstrate that the proposed approach can significantly improve the classification accuracy.
1363,227-1,"Since the beginning of the soil moisture and ocean salinity mission, the pervading presence of radio frequency interferences (RFI) has been one of the mast problematic issues."
1364,227-2,"The effect of an RFI is not just a hot spot but also six tails along the three main axes, and the general presence of ripples which degrade the quality of L1 brightness temperature snapshots."
1365,227-3,"The standard mitigation technique is to apply an apodization (Blackman), but such a low-pass filter leaves traces of the tails and spreads the signal of the main lobes."
1366,227-4,"New RFI mitigation techniques, such as nodal sampling, are very effective in reducing the impact of tails and ripples, but in some cases they lead to the spread of the RFI main lobe, with a significant loss of data on the affected area."
1367,227-5,"In this letter, we propose a new technique to reduce their spread by an adaptive thresholding on a bandpass filtered version of the snapshot, with a significant recovery of data."
1368,228-1,"To obtain spatial feature distributions from the mixed pixels of remote sensing images and increase the accuracy of land-cover classification and recognition, a double-calculated spatial attraction model (DSAM) based on the combination of spatial attraction model (SAM) and pixel swapping model (PSM) is presented and verified by introducing the law of universal gravitation to describe the attraction between pixels."
1369,228-2,"In DSAM, SAM was used to improve the initialization algorithm of PSM, and the optimization algorithm of PSM was improved accordingly."
1370,228-3,"Using a SPOT-5 remote sensing image, related subpixel mapping (SPM) experiments were performed to verify the SPM effect of DSAM and to test its accuracy."
1371,228-4,The experimental results indicated that the DSAM SPM results were superior to the SPM results of SAM and PSM.
1372,228-5,"DSAM was proven effective and applicable for the SPM of remotely sensed images, and the model can improve the accuracy of SPM and landcover classification."
1373,229-1,We solve the problem of scene recognition from very high-resolution optical satellite remote sensing (RS) images by exploring the notion of mid-level feature mining.
1374,229-2,The existing mid-level feature extraction techniques are based on applying feature encodings over a set of discriminatively selected localized feature descriptors from the images.
1375,229-3,"Such techniques inherently suffer from two shortcomings: 1) the local descriptors are not enough discriminative, since they are mostly based on sole invariant feature transform (SIFT) like ad hoc features and 2) the definition of a robust ranking function to select discriminative local features is nontrivial."
1376,229-4,"As a remedy, we propose a pattern mining-based approach for an efficient discovery of mid-level visual elements, which considers convolutional neural network features of the category-independent region proposals extracted from the images as the local descriptors."
1377,229-5,"While the region proposals depict better semantic information than the SIFT like features, the proposed pattern mining strategy can efficiently highlight the correlations between such local descriptors and the class labels."
1378,229-6,Experimental results suggest that the proposed technique outperforms a number of existing mid-level feature descriptors for the standard optical RS data sets.
1379,23-1,Synthetic aperture radar (SAR) is one of the most widely employed remote sensing modalities for large-scale monitoring of maritime activity.
1380,23-2,"Ship detection in SAR images is a challenging task due to inherent speckle, discernible sea clutter, and the little exploitable shape information the targets present."
1381,23-3,"Constant false alarm rate (CFAR) detectors, utilizing various sea clutter statistical models and thresholding schemes, are near ubiquitous in the literature."
1382,23-4,"Very few of the proposed CFAR variants deviate from the classical CFAR topology; this letter proposes a modified topology, utilizing superpixels (SPs) in lieu of rectangular sliding windows to define CFAR guardbands and background."
1383,23-5,The aim is to achieve better target exclusion from the background band and reduced false detections.
1384,23-6,"The performance of this modified SP-CFAR algorithm is demonstrated on TerraSAR-X and SENTINEL-1 images, achieving superior results in comparison to classical CFAR for various background distributions."
1385,230-1,Automatic airport extraction in remote sensing images (RSIs) has been widely applied in military and civil applications.
1386,230-2,An efficient airport extraction framework for RSIs is constructed in this letter.
1387,230-3,"In the first step, we put forward a two-way complementary saliency analysis (CSA) scheme that combines vision-oriented saliency and knowledge-oriented saliency for the airport position estimation."
1388,230-4,"In the second step, we construct a saliency-oriented active contour model (SOACM) for airport contour tracking, where a saliency orientation term is incorporated into the level-set-based energy functions."
1389,230-5,"Under the guidance of saliency feature representations obtained by CSA, the SOACM can acquire well-defined and highly precise object contours."
1390,230-6,"Experimental results demonstrate that the proposed extraction framework shows good adaptability in remote sensing scenes, and uniformly achieves high detection rate and low false alarm rate."
1391,230-7,"Compared with three state-of-the-art algorithms, our proposal can not only estimate the location of airport targets, but also extract detailed information of the airport contours."
1392,231-1,"Due to the inevitable existence of clouds and their shadows in optical remote sensing images, certain ground-cover information is degraded or even appears to be missing, which limits analysis and utilization."
1393,231-2,"Thus, cloud removal is of great importance to facilitate downstream applications."
1394,231-3,"Motivated by the sparse representation techniques which have obtained a stunning performance in a variety of applications, including target detection, anomaly detection, and so on; we propose a two-pass robust principal component analysis (RPCA) framework for cloud removal in the satellite image sequence."
1395,231-4,"First, a plain RPCA is applied for initial cloud region detection, followed by a straight-forward morphological operation to ensure that the cloud region is completely detected."
1396,231-5,"Subsequently, a discriminative RPCA algorithm is proposed to assign aggressive penalizing weights to the detected cloud pixels to facilitate cloud removal and scene restoration."
1397,231-6,"Significantly superior to currently available methods, neither a cloud-free reference image nor a specific algorithm of cloud detection is required in our method."
1398,231-7,"Experiments on both simulated and real images yield visually plausible and numerically verified results, demonstrating the effectiveness of our method."
1399,232-1,"Convolutional neural network obtains remarkable achievements on target detection, due to its prominent capability on feature extraction."
1400,232-2,"However, it still needs further study for aircraft detection task, since intraclass variation still restricts the accuracy of aircraft detection in remote sensing images."
1401,232-3,"In this letter, we adopt regularity of aircraft circle response to design our end-to-end fully convolutional network (FCN), and embed online exemplar mining into our network to handle intraclass variation."
1402,232-4,"The mined exemplars are employed to capture different intraclass characteristics, which effectively reduces the burden of network training."
1403,232-5,"Specifically, we first select basic exemplars based on labeled information and initialize the relationships between exemplars and aircraft examples."
1404,232-6,"Then, these relationships will he updated by the similarity of these examples in high-level features space."
1405,232-7,"Finally, aircraft examples will be used to train different exemplar detectors according to updated relationships."
1406,232-8,"Motivated by the geometric shape of aircraft, a circle response map is developed to construct our FCN to achieve more efficient aircraft detection."
1407,232-9,The comparative experiments indicate that superior performance of our network in accurate and efficient aircraft detection.
1408,233-1,A confident knowledge of land surface emissivity at viewing zenith angles far from nadir is of prime interest to perform an accurate correction of the anisotropy effect in the measurements made by orbiting thermal infrared (TIR) sensors.
1409,233-2,"It is also important for the correct treatment of angular measurements carried out by remote sensors such as AATSR/ENVISAT, MODIS/Terra-Aqua, or the recently launched SLSTR/Sentinel-3, which can also be used for the angular normalization of land surface temperature due to viewing geometry effect."
1410,233-3,"In this letter, the anisotropy of TIR emissivity predicted by two analytical, Warren-Wiscombe-Dozier and Hapke, models based on Mie diffraction theory was compared with field-measured values under dry conditions."
1411,233-4,"The results showed good agreement between models and measurements (RMSEs ranging from +/- 0.004 to +/- 0.030 depending on the sample, with an average value of +/- 0.016) if the compactness of the grains soil is taken into account, demonstrating the good performance of the cosine term of the zenith angle included in the expressions of both models."
1412,233-5,"A significant disagreement between models and measurements is, however, obtained for some samples at high zenith angles, suggesting the necessity of a fudge factor to include in the compactness correction in that condition."
1413,234-1,Morphological attribute profiles (APs) have thus far been proven effective for remote sensing image classification by several research studies.
1414,234-2,"However, recent studies have shown that a direct application of APs to highly textured and structured images, especially in very high-resolution (VHR) optical imagery, may be insufficient."
1415,234-3,"Some solutions have been proposed to deal with this issue, such as to extract the local histograms and the local features of AP images [histogram-based APs (HAPs) and local feature-based APs (LFAP), respectively], or to combine APs with different textural features."
1416,234-4,"In this letter, we review these approaches and then propose a novel strategy, which directly generates APs on some derived textural features instead of separately combining them."
1417,234-5,"Experimental results from both natural textures and VHR optical remotely sensed images show that the proposed approach can produce superior classification performance than the standard APs, HAPs, LFAPs, as well as the classical combination of APs with textural features."
1418,235-1,"In recent years, differential carrier phase-based relative positioning (or ""baseline determination"") with precision at the millimeter and submillimeter levels has been demonstrated for the GRACE, TanDEM-X and Swarm missions in offline processing."
1419,235-2,Specific features of such missions have included the use of spacecraft of similar shapes placed in almost identical orbits as well as the use of consistent geodetic-class GPS receivers.
1420,235-3,These elements have proven to be advantageous for the computation of baseline solutions with such precision levels.
1421,235-4,"Particularly, they have allowed to fully leverage the use of differential GPS techniques, including the estimation and use of carrier phase integer ambiguities."
1422,235-5,"Similarly, the aforementioned spacecraft and orbit characteristics have made it possible to tightly constrain the relative dynamics of formations in the generation of reduced-dynamic solutions."
1423,235-6,"Other than the former examples, prospective formation-flying mission proposals, such as SAOCOM-CS and PICOSAR, may comprise spacecraft with very different characteristics, including dissimilar GPS/GNSS receivers."
1424,235-7,Such cases may no longer provide favorable conditions for relative orbit determination strategies.
1425,235-8,"As an alternative, absolute orbit solutions may be computed individually for each spacecraft and used for the generation of precise baseline products."
1426,235-9,This study aims at the assessment of the potential of single-receiver ambiguity fixing for the generation of precise baseline solutions.
1427,235-10,"Results using flight data from the GRACE, TanDEM-X and Swarm missions exhibit baseline accuracy better than 5 mm (3D RMS) for a one-month test period in June 2016."
1428,235-11,"As such, the presented solutions may be considered for prospective formation-flying remote sensing missions with baseline precision requirements at the subcentimeter level."
1429,235-12,"Likewise, the method is considered of particular interest for future multi-spacecraft formations and swarms that require efficient determination of a large number of individual baselines."
1430,236-1,In the article we present an analytic aspect of TLS multi-station least-squares adjustment with the main focus on the datum problem.
1431,236-2,"The datum problem is, compared to previously published researches, theoretically analyzed and solved, where the solution is based on nullspace derivation of the mathematical model."
1432,236-3,The importance of datum problem solution is seen in a complete description of TLS multi-station adjustment solutions from a set of all minimally constrained least-squares solutions.
1433,236-4,"On a basis of known nullspace, estimable parameters are described and the geometric interpretation of all minimally constrained least squares solutions is presented."
1434,236-5,At the end a simulated example is used to analyze the results of TLS multi-station minimally constrained and inner constrained least-squares adjustment solutions.
1435,237-1,Microwave imagery has a distinct advantage over optical imagery in high-latitude areas because it allows data to be acquired independently of cloud cover and solar illumination.
1436,237-2,Synthetic aperture radar (SAR)-based monitoring has become increasingly important for understanding the state and dynamics of permafrost landscapes at the regional scale.
1437,237-3,This study presents a permafrost landscape mapping method that uses multi-temporal TerraSAR-X backscatter intensity and interferometric coherence information.
1438,237-4,The proposed method can classify permafrost landscape features and map the two most important features in sub-arctic permafrost environments: permafrost-affected areas and thermokarst ponds.
1439,237-5,"First, a land cover map is generated through the combined use of object-based image analysis (OBIA) and classification and regression tree (CART) analysis."
1440,237-6,"An overall accuracy of 98% is achieved when classifying rock and water bodies, and an accuracy of 79% is achieved when discriminating between different vegetation types with one year of single-polarized acquisitions."
1441,237-7,"Second, the distributions of the permafrost affected areas and thermokarst ponds are derived from the classified landscapes."
1442,237-8,"Permafrost-affected areas are inferred from the relationship between vegetation cover and the existence of permafrost, and thermokarst pond distributions are directly inherited from the land cover map."
1443,237-9,The two mapped features exhibit good agreement with manually delineated references.
1444,237-10,The proposed method can produce permafrost landscape maps in complex sub-arctic environments and improve our understanding of the effects of climate change on permafrost landscapes.
1445,237-11,"This classification strategy can be transferred to other time-series SAR datasets, e.g., Sentinel-1, and other heterogeneous environments."
1446,238-1,Land surface temperature (LST) is one of the most important parameters in land surface processes.
1447,238-2,"Although satellite-derived LST can provide valuable information, the value is often limited by cloud contamination."
1448,238-3,"In this paper, a two-step satellite-derived LST reconstruction framework is proposed."
1449,238-4,"First, a multi-temporal reconstruction algorithm is introduced to recover invalid LST values using multiple LST images with reference to corresponding remotely sensed vegetation index."
1450,238-5,"Then, all cloud contaminated areas are temporally filled with hypothetical clear-sky LST values."
1451,238-6,"Second, a surface energy balance equation-based procedure is used to correct for the filled values."
1452,238-7,"With shortwave irradiation data, the clear-sky LST is corrected to the real LST under cloudy conditions."
1453,238-8,A series of experiments have been performed to demonstrate the effectiveness of the developed approach.
1454,238-9,Quantitative evaluation results indicate that the proposed method can recover LST in different surface types with mean average errors in 3-6K.
1455,238-10,The experiments also indicate that the time interval between the multi-temporal LST images has a greater impact on the results than the size of the contaminated area.
1456,239-1,Sparse unmixing aims at recovering pure materials from hyperpspectral images and estimating their abundance fractions.
1457,239-2,"Sparse unmixing is actually l(0) problem which is NP-h ard, and a relaxation is often used."
1458,239-3,"In this paper, we attempt to deal with l(0) problem directly via a multi-objective based method, which is a non-convex manner."
1459,239-4,"The characteristics of hyperspectral images are integrated into the proposed method, which leads to a new spectra and multi-objective based sparse unmixing method (SMoSU)."
1460,239-5,"In order to solve the l(0) norm optimization problem, the spectral library is encoded in a binary vector, and a bit-wise flipping strategy is used to generate new individuals in the evolution process."
1461,239-6,"However, a multi-objective method usually produces a number of non-dominated solutions, while sparse unmixing requires a single solution."
1462,239-7,How to make the final decision for sparse unmixing is challenging.
1463,239-8,"To handle this problem, we integrate the spectral characteristic of hyperspectral images into SMoSU."
1464,239-9,"By considering the spectral correlation in hyperspectral data, we improve the Tchebycheff decomposition function in SMoSU via a new regularization item."
1465,239-10,This regularization item is able to enforce the individual divergence in the evolution process of SMoSU.
1466,239-11,"In this way, the diversity and convergence of population is further balanced, which is beneficial to the concentration of individuals."
1467,239-12,"In the experiments part, three synthetic datasets and one real-world data are used to analyse the effectiveness of SMoSU, and several state-of-art sparse unmixing algorithms are compared."
1468,24-1,"As an unsupervised learning tool, autoencoder has been widely applied in many fields."
1469,24-2,"In this letter, we propose a new robust unmixing algorithm that is based on stacked nonnegative sparse autoencoders (NNSAEs) for hyperspectral data with outliers and low signal-to-noise ratio."
1470,24-3,The proposed stacked autoencoders network contains two main steps.
1471,24-4,"In the first step, a series of NNSAE is used to detect the outliers in the data."
1472,24-5,"In the second step, a final autoencoder is performed for unmixing to achieve the endmember signatures and abundance fractions."
1473,24-6,"By taking advantage from nonnegative sparse autoencoding, the proposed approach can well tackle problems with outliers and low noise-signal ratio."
1474,24-7,The effectiveness of the proposed method is evaluated on both synthetic and real hyperspectral data.
1475,24-8,"In comparison with other unmixing methods, the proposed approach demonstrates competitive performance."
1476,240-1,"In object-based image analysis (OBIA), object classification performance is jointly determined by image segmentation, sample or rule setting, and classifiers."
1477,240-2,"Typically, as a crucial step to obtain object primitives, image segmentation quality significantly influences subsequent feature extraction and analyses."
1478,240-3,"By contrast, template matching extracts specific objects from images and prevents shape defects caused by image segmentation."
1479,240-4,"However, creating or editing templates is tedious and sometimes results in incomplete or inaccurate templates."
1480,240-5,"In this study, we combine OBIA and template matching techniques to address these problems and aim for accurate photovoltaic panel (PVP) extraction from very high resolution (VHR) aerial imagery."
1481,240-6,"The proposed method is based on the previously proposed region-line primitive association framework, in which complementary information between region (segment) and line (straight line) primitives is utilized to achieve a more powerful performance than routine OBIA."
1482,240-7,"Several novel concepts, including the mutual fitting ratio and best-fitting template based on region-line primitive association analyses, are proposed."
1483,240-8,Automatic template generation and matching method for PVP extraction from VHR imagery are designed for concept and model validation.
1484,240-9,Results show that the proposed method can successfully extract PVPs without any user-specified matching template or training sample.
1485,240-10,High user independency and accuracy are the main characteristics of the proposed method in comparison with routine OBIA and template matching techniques.
1486,241-1,"Vegetation in river floodplains has important functions for biodiversity, but can also have a negative influence on flood safety."
1487,241-2,Floodplain vegetation is becoming increasingly heterogeneous in space and time as a result of river restoration projects.
1488,241-3,"To document the spatio-temporal patterns of the floodplain vegetation, the need arises for efficient monitoring techniques."
1489,241-4,"Monitoring is commonly performed by mapping floodplains based on single-epoch remote sensing data, thereby not considering seasonal dynamics of vegetation."
1490,241-5,The rising availability of unmanned airborne vehicles (UAV) increases monitoring frequency potential.
1491,241-6,"Therefore, we aimed to evaluate the performance of multi-temporal high spatial-resolution imagery, collected with a UAV, to record the dynamics in floodplain vegetation height and greenness over a growing season."
1492,241-7,"Since the classification accuracy of current airborne surveys remains insufficient for low vegetation types, we focussed on seasonal variation of herbaceous and grassy vegetation with a height up to 3 m."
1493,241-8,"Field reference data on vegetation height were collected six times during one year in 28 field plots within a single floodplain along the Waal River, the main distributary of the Rhine River in the Netherlands."
1494,241-9,"Simultaneously with each field survey, we recorded UAV true colour and false-colour imagery from which normalized digital surface models (nDSMs) and a consumer-grade camera vegetation index (CGCVI) were calculated."
1495,241-10,"We observed that: (1) the accuracy of a UAV-derived digital terrain model (DTM) varies over the growing season and is most accurate during winter when the vegetation is dormant, (2) vegetation height can be determined from the nDSMs in leaf on conditions via linear regression (RSME = 0.17-0.33 m), (3) the multitemporal nDSMs yielded meaningful temporal profiles of greenness and vegetation height and (4) herbaceous vegetation shows hysteresis for greenness and vegetation height, but no clear hysteresis was observed for grassland vegetation."
1496,241-11,These results show the high potential of using UAV-borne sensors for increasing the classification accuracy of low floodplain vegetation within the framework of floodplain monitoring.
1497,242-1,Object-based image analysis (OBIA) has gained widespread popularity for creating maps from remotely sensed data.
1498,242-2,"Researchers routinely claim that OBIA procedures outperform pixel-based procedures; however, it is not immediately obvious how to evaluate the degree to which an OBIA map compares to reference information in a manner that accounts for the fact that the OBIA map consists of objects that vary in size and shape."
1499,242-3,Our study reviews 209 journal articles concerning OBIA published between 2003 and 2017.
1500,242-4,"We focus on the three stages of accuracy assessment: (1) sampling design, (2) response design and (3) accuracy analysis."
1501,242-5,"First, we report the literature's overall characteristics concerning OBIA accuracy assessment."
1502,242-6,"Simple random sampling was the most used method among probability sampling strategies, slightly more than stratified sampling."
1503,242-7,Office interpreted remotely sensed data was the dominant reference source.
1504,242-8,"The literature reported accuracies ranging from 42% to 96%, with an average of 85%."
1505,242-9,A third of the articles failed to give sufficient information concerning accuracy methodology such as sampling scheme and sample size.
1506,242-10,We found few studies that focused specifically on the accuracy of the segmentation.
1507,242-11,"Second, we identify a recent increase of OBIA articles in using per-polygon approaches compared to per-pixel approaches for accuracy assessment."
1508,242-12,"We clarify the impacts of the per-pixel versus the per polygon approaches respectively on sampling, response design and accuracy analysis."
1509,242-13,"Our review defines the technical and methodological needs in the current per-polygon approaches, such as polygon-based sampling, analysis of mixed polygons, matching of mapped with reference polygons and assessment of segmentation accuracy."
1510,242-14,Our review summarizes and discusses the current issues in object-based accuracy assessment to provide guidance for improved accuracy assessments for OBIA.
1511,243-1,"Extraction of leaf area index (LAI) is an important prerequisite in numerous studies related to plant ecology, physiology and breeding."
1512,243-2,LAI is indicative for the performance of a plant canopy and of its potential for growth and yield.
1513,243-3,"In this study, a novel method to estimate LAI based on RGB images taken by an unmanned aerial system (UAS) is introduced."
1514,243-4,Soybean was taken as the model crop of investigation.
1515,243-5,The method integrates viewing geometry information in an approach related to gap fraction theory.
1516,243-6,A 3-D simulation of virtual canopies helped developing and verifying the underlying model.
1517,243-7,"In addition, the method includes techniques to extract plot based data from individual oblique images using image projection, as well as image segmentation applying an active learning approach."
1518,243-8,Data from a soybean field experiment were used to validate the method.
1519,243-9,"The thereby measured LAI prediction accuracy was comparable with the one of a gap fraction-based handheld device (R-2 of 0.92, RMSE of 0.42 m M-2(-2)) and correlated well with destructive LAI measurements (R-2 of 0.89, RMSE of 0.41 m(2) m(-2))."
1520,243-10,"These results indicate that, if respecting the range (LAI <= 3) the method was tested for, extracting LAI from UAS derived RGB images using viewing geometry information represents a valid alternative to destructive and optical handheld device LAI measurements in soybean."
1521,243-11,"Thereby, we open the door for automated, high-throughput assessment of LAI in plant and crop science."
1522,244-1,"Spectral unmixing provides, for each pixel in the image, an estimated vector of fractional abundances that correspond to pure signatures, known as endmembers (EMs)."
1523,244-2,Standard unmixing techniques rely only on spectral information and each pixel is solved as an individual entity.
1524,244-3,Recent studies show that incorporating the image's spatial information enhances accuracy of the unmixing results.
1525,244-4,"Spatial information may allow better selection of relevant EMs, for each pixel, rather than utilizing all potential EMs in solving the spectral mixing problem."
1526,244-5,"To implement this approach, we developed a new method for spatially adaptive spectral unmixing called Gaussian-based spatially adaptive unmixing (GBSAU)."
1527,244-6,"GBSAU fits for each EM, a surface by a series of spatial anisotropic 2D Gaussians whose sum represents the EM's fraction distribution over the whole image."
1528,244-7,"These analytical surfaces facilitate a sparse solution for the unmixing process by spatial localization of EMs, which is then used to determine an adaptive subset of actual EMs for each pixel."
1529,244-8,"The performance of our novel method was compared with that of the state-of-art spatially adaptive unimximg method, sparse unmixing via variable splitting augmented Lagrangian and total variation (SUnSAL-TV) as well as with two ordinary non-spatial methods, sparse unmixing by variable splitting and augmented Lagrangian (SUnSAL) and vectorized code projected gradient descent unmixing (VPGDU)."
1530,244-9,The comparison was carried out on both simulated and real hyperspectral images.
1531,244-10,The results obtained with GBSAU indicated a significant improvement in the overall accuracy of the unmixing process compared with both spatially adaptive and ordinary methods.
1532,244-11,"Quantitatively, GBSAU reduces the average mean absolute error (MAE) of the results by similar to 15%, for cases with SNR = 30 db and 20 db, and by similar to 30% for cases with SNR = 10 db and 5 db."
1533,245-1,Detection of objects from satellite optical remote sensing images is very important for many commercial and governmental applications.
1534,245-2,"With the development of deep convolutional neural networks (deep CNNs), the field of object detection has seen tremendous advances."
1535,245-3,"Currently, objects in satellite remote sensing images can be detected using deep CNNs."
1536,245-4,"In general, optical remote sensing images contain many dense and small objects, and the use of the original Faster Regional CNN framework does not yield a suitably high precision."
1537,245-5,"Therefore, after careful analysis we adopt dense convoluted networks, a multi-scale representation and various combinations of improvement schemes to enhance the structure of the base VGG16-Net for improving the precision."
1538,245-6,We propose an approach to reduce the test-time (detection time) and memory requirements.
1539,245-7,"To validate the effectiveness of our approach, we perform experiments using satellite remote sensing image datasets of aircraft and automobiles."
1540,245-8,The results show that the improved network structure can detect objects in satellite optical remote sensing images more accurately and efficiently.
1541,246-1,"Geographical object-based image analysis (GEOBIA) is widely used for the processing of fine spatial resolution images, with increased research on contextual modelling and classification related to GEOBIA."
1542,246-2,"Specifically, a previously developed object-based image classification method, known as geostatistically weighted k-NN (gk-NN) method, has shown advantages in increasing classification accuracy."
1543,246-3,The gk-NN method incorporates spatial weighting into the k-NN classifier through modelling spatial covariance of underlying area classes.
1544,246-4,"However, change-of-support problem (COSP) due to different geometries of image objects is not considered therein."
1545,246-5,"In this paper, we propose a method based on geostatistical de-regularization and regularization for quantifying spatial dependence in area-class occurrences and accounting for scale discrepancy in image objects and pixels."
1546,246-6,"In this new modelling approach, an area-weighted (AW) distance measure is applied for modelling spatial covariance pertaining to sample image objects."
1547,246-7,"The covariance model fitted with image objects sample data is de-regularized to a point-support one, so the spatial covariance over unsampled image objects can then be computed through regularization of a point-support model (RP)."
1548,246-8,"Unlike the previous modelling approach in the object based gk-NN classification, whereby spatial dependence modelling is based on centroids of image objects, this method accounts for change of support and incorporates the geometry of image objects in modelling."
1549,246-9,"The new modelling method was tested on three remote-sensing image subsets with different environments, using regular and irregular segmentation methods at hierarchical scales."
1550,246-10,"It was confirmed that the RP method leads to largely significant increases in classification accuracies (with an average increase of 38.09% in classification accuracy with eighteen cases), compared with that by geostatistical modelling with image object centroids."
1551,246-11,The proposed method can be used for the modelling of spatial dependence in block-support data which are common in many geospatial applications.
1552,247-1,Land Use/Cover Change (LUCC) detection relies increasingly on comparing remote sensing images with different spatial and spectral scales.
1553,247-2,"Based on scale-invariant image analysis algorithms in computer vision, we propose a scale-invariant LUCC detection method to identify changes from scale heterogeneous images."
1554,247-3,"This method is composed of an entropy-based spatial decomposition, two scale invariant feature extraction methods, Maximally Stable Extremal Region (MSER) and Scale-Invariant Feature Transformation (SIFT) algorithms, a spatial regression voting method to integrate MSER and SIFT results, a Markov Random Field-based smoothing method, and a support vector machine classification method to assign LUCC labels."
1555,247-4,"We test the scale invariance of our new method with a LUCC case study in Montreal, Canada, 2005-2012."
1556,247-5,We found that the scale-invariant LUCC detection method provides similar accuracy compared with the resampling-based approach but this method avoids the LUCC distortion incurred by resampling.
1557,248-1,This paper presents a novel hierarchical approach to solving structure-from-motion (SFM) problems.
1558,248-2,The algorithm begins with small local reconstructions based on nonlinear bundle adjustment (BA).
1559,248-3,These are then joined in a hierarchical manner using a strategy that requires solving a linear least squares optimization problem followed by a nonlinear transform.
1560,248-4,The algorithm can handle ordered monocular and stereo image sequences.
1561,248-5,Two stereo images or three monocular images are adequate for building each initial reconstruction.
1562,248-6,"The bulk of the computation involves solving a linear least squares problem and, therefore, the proposed algorithm avoids three major issues associated with most of the nonlinear optimization algorithms currently used for SFM: the need for a reasonably accurate initial estimate, the need for iterations, and the possibility of being trapped in a local minimum."
1563,248-7,"Also, by summarizing all the original observations into the small local reconstructions with associated information matrices, the proposed Linear SFM manages to preserve all the information contained in the observations."
1564,248-8,The paper also demonstrates that the proposed problem formulation results in a sparse structure that leads to an efficient numerical implementation.
1565,248-9,The experimental results using publicly available datasets show that the proposed algorithm yields solutions that are very close to those obtained using a global BA starting with an accurate initial estimate.
1566,248-10,The C/C++ source code of the proposed algorithm is publicly available at https://github.com/LiangZhaoPKUlmperial/LinearSFM.
1567,249-1,Conventional classification algorithms have shown great success for balanced classes.
1568,249-2,"In remote sensing applications, it is often the case that classes are imbalanced."
1569,249-3,This paper proposes a novel solution to solve the problem of imbalanced training samples in hyperspectral image classification.
1570,249-4,It consists of two parts: one is for large-size sample sets and the other is for small-size sets.
1571,249-5,"Specifically, an algorithm based on the orthogonal complement subspace projection (OCSP) is proposed to select samples from large-size classes, and an algorithm also based on OCSP is proposed to create artificial samples for small-size ones."
1572,249-6,"The impact on representation-based classifiers, i.e., sparse and collaborative representation classifiers and traditional classifiers (e.g., support vector machine), is investigated."
1573,249-7,Experimental results demonstrate that the proposed solution can outperform other existing solutions in the literature.
1574,25-1,Hyperspectral remote sensing images present rich information on the characteristics of different physical materials.
1575,25-2,"Utilizing the rich information, classifiers can distinguish these different materials."
1576,25-3,"The minimum distance technique, which is commonly used in classification, is sensitive to the distance metric, especially in high-dimensional space."
1577,25-4,"In this letter, we study the effect of the p-norm distance metric on the minimum distance technique and propose a supervised-learning p-norm distance metric to optimize the value of p."
1578,25-5,"In the experimental study, we take the minimum distance and the k-nearest neighbor classifiers as examples to test the proposed supervised-learning p-norm distance metric."
1579,25-6,The results suggest that the supervised-learning p-norm distance metric can improve the performance of a classifier for hyperspectral remote sensing image classification.
1580,250-1,Unmixing is an important issue of hyperspectral images.
1581,250-2,Most unmixing methods adopt linear mixing models for simplicity.
1582,250-3,"However, multiple scattering usually occurs between vegetation and soil in a bilinear scene."
1583,250-4,"Thus, nonlinear mixing problems which are difficult to be solved should be taken into consideration under this circumstance."
1584,250-5,"In practice, both linear and nonlinear spectral mixtures exist in hyperspectral scenes."
1585,250-6,"Considering the characteristics of different regions in images, we propose a hybrid unmixing algorithm for hyperspectral images based on region adaptive segmentation."
1586,250-7,"Our method uses a standard K-means clustering algorithm to obtain different regions, including homogeneous regions and detailed regions."
1587,250-8,"The model of the homogeneous regions is assumed to be linear, which will be pursued using the method of sparse-constrained nonnegative matrix factorization (NMF), and the mixing in the detailed regions is assumed to be based on a nonlinear model."
1588,250-9,"We also propose a new nonlinear unmixing method, called graphregularized semi-NMF, which considers the manifold structure of hyperspectral data as the unmixing method to deal with the detailed regions."
1589,250-10,"Finally, by combining the two regions, we obtain the abundance of the whole hyperspectral image."
1590,250-11,The proposed method can not only achieve more precise abundance but also be good at keeping the edge information of the bilinear abundance.
1591,250-12,The experimental results on both synthetic and real data also show that the proposed method is effective for improving the unmixing accuracy of hyperspectral remote-sensing images.
1592,251-1,Heterogeneous terrain significantly complicates signals received by airborne or satellite sensors.
1593,251-2,It has been demonstrated that both solar direct beam and diffuse skylight illumination conditions are significant factors influencing the anisotropy of reflectance over mountainous areas.
1594,251-3,Several models and methods have been developed to account for topographic effects on surface reflectance at the pixel level in remote sensing.
1595,251-4,"However, subtopographic effects are generally neglected for lowspatial-resolution pixels due to the complex law of radiative transfer and the limitations of higher spatial resolution digital elevation models, which can lead to deviations in reflectance estimation."
1596,251-5,Accurately estimating the subtopographic effects on anisotropic reflectance over composite sloping terrain under different illumination conditions presents a challenge for remote sensing models and applications.
1597,251-6,"In this paper, the diffused equivalent slope model (dESM) was developed, which is an anisotropic reflectance simulation model coupled with diffuse skylight over composite sloping terrain."
1598,251-7,The corresponding subtopographic impact factor was also proposed to exhibit how microslope topography affects reflectance over composite sloping terrain under different illumination conditions.
1599,251-8,Simulated reflectance data sets simulated by the radiosity method and Moderate Resolution Imaging Spectroradiometer reflectance data were used to evaluate the performance of the dESM model.
1600,251-9,"The results reveal that the dESM model can accurately capture the reflectance anisotropy over composite sloping terrain under different illumination conditions, and the subtopographic impact factor can account for the effects of microslope topography, shadow, and illumination conditions."
1601,252-1,The knowledge of atmospheric column water vapor concentration is crucial for compensating water absorption effects in remote sensing data.
1602,252-2,Several algorithms for the estimation of such a parameter were proposed in the past.
1603,252-3,One of the most effective algorithms is the atmospheric precorrected differential absorption (APDA) technique.
1604,252-4,APDA relies on a simplified radiative transfer model (RTM) that does not account for the spatial variability of the adjacency effects.
1605,252-5,"In this paper, we study the impact of the simplified RTM assumption on the performance of the algorithm by exploiting a more realistic and well-established RTM."
1606,252-6,"Starting from such a model, we derive a new water retrieval algorithm called low-rank subspace projection-based water estimator."
1607,252-7,It exploits the high degree of spectral correlation experienced in the reflectances of most of the existing materials.
1608,252-8,An extensive experimental analysis is carried out on simulated data in order to assess and compare the performance of the two algorithms.
1609,252-9,Simulation results allow the critical analysis of the two algorithms by highlighting their strengths and drawbacks.
1610,253-1,High spatial resolution (HSR) remote sensing images provide detailed geometric information about land cover.
1611,253-2,"As a result, it is possible to detect more subtle changes with the help of HSR images."
1612,253-3,"However, due to the increased spatial resolution and the limited spectral information, it is difficult to identify the real changes only through the spectral feature of the image."
1613,253-4,"To fully explore the spectral-spatial information and improve the change detection performance for HSR images, this paper proposes the hybrid conditional random field (HCRF) model, which combines the traditional random field method with an object-based technique."
1614,253-5,"In the proposed method, the spectral discriminative information of a single pixel is extracted by the unary potential, which is modeled using a soft clustering method to make an initial separation of changed and unchanged pixels."
1615,253-6,The pairwise potential then considers the contextual information of adjacent pixels to favor spatial smoothing.
1616,253-7,An object term is also introduced in the HCRF model to keep the homogeneity of changed objects.
1617,253-8,"By the use of these approaches, the oversmoothing problem of the random field-based methods and the detection error caused by the segmentation strategy in the objectbased methods can be relieved."
1618,253-9,The proposed method was tested on three HSR image data sets and outperformed the compared state-of-the-art techniques.
1619,254-1,The Global Precipitation Measurement (GPM) mission was launched in February 2014; its dual-frequency precipitation radar (DPR) operates at both Ku- and Ka-bands.
1620,254-2,"Attenuation in precipitation is typically not negligible, especially at Ka-band."
1621,254-3,"Hence, attenuation correction is an important part of the GPM DPR retrieval algorithm."
1622,254-4,"The operational algorithm uses a path-integrated attenuation (PIA) obtained by comparing the measured surface return with that expected either from a nearby, nonprecipitating area or from the same area, acquired at a previous, nonprecipitating time."
1623,254-5,"This surface reference technique has worked well in most situations but can result in erroneously low estimates of the path attenuation in situations with nonuniform filling of the radar beam, especially at Ka-band due to its larger attenuation."
1624,254-6,This paper explores the existence of relationships between the Ka-band PIA and the characteristics of the measured reflectivity profiles.
1625,254-7,"The author finds that PIA is, indeed, related to reflectivity profiles, with strongest correlation between the PIA and the measured rainfall dual-frequency reflectivity ratio just above the surface."
1626,254-8,This relationship could be used as an estimator in the cases with severe nonuniform beam filling.
1627,255-1,Consistent and scalable estimation of vegetation structural parameters-essential to understanding forest ecosystems-is widely investigated through remote sensing imaging spectroscopy.
1628,255-2,"NASA's proposed spaceborne mission, the Hyperspectral Infrared Imager (HyspIRI), will measure spectral radiance from 380 to 2500 nm in 10-nm contiguous bands with a 60-m ground sample distance (GSD) and provide a global benchmark from which future changes can be assessed."
1629,255-3,"The historic foci of spectrometers have been foliar/canopy biochemistry and species classification; however, given the relatively large GSD of a spaceborne instrument, there is uncertainty as to the effects of subpixel vegetation structure on observed radiance."
1630,255-4,"This paper, therefore, evaluates the linkages between the withinpixel vegetation structure and imaging spectroscopy signals at the pixel level."
1631,255-5,We constructed a realistic virtual forest scene representing the National Ecological Observatory Network (NEON) Pacific Southwest domain site.
1632,255-6,Anticipated HyspIRI data (60-m GSD) for this site were then simulated using the physicsdriven Digital Imaging and Remote Sensing Image Generation (DIRSIG) model.
1633,255-7,Both the models were first validated via comparison to overflow classic Airborne Visible/Infrared Imaging Spectrometer and NEON's imaging spectrometer (NIS).
1634,255-8,"Then, to assess the impact of within-pixel: 1) tree canopy cover (CC); 2) tree positioning; and 3) distribution on large-footprint HyspIRI signals, we generated the variations of the baseline virtual forest scene and measured the anticipated spectral radiance using DIRSIG."
1635,255-9,Results indicate that HyspIRI is sensitive to subpixel vegetation structural variation in the visible to a short-wavelength infrared spectrum due to vegetation structural changes.
1636,255-10,This has implications for improving the system's suitability for consistent global vegetation structural assessments by adapting calibration strategies to account for this subpixel variation.
1637,256-1,Scene classification has been successfully applied to the semantic interpretation of large high-resolution images (HRIs).
1638,256-2,The bag-of-words (BOW) model has been proven to be effective but inadequate for HRIs because of the complex arrangement of the ground objects and the multiple types of land cover.
1639,256-3,How to define the scenes in HRIs is still a problem for scene classification.
1640,256-4,"The previous methods involve selecting the scenes manually or with a fixed spatial distribution, leading to scenes with a mixture of objects from different categories."
1641,256-5,"In this paper, to address these issues, a scene capture method using adjacent segmented images and a support vector machine classifier is proposed to generate scenes dominated by one category."
1642,256-6,"The codebook in BOW is obtained from clustering features extracted from all the categories, which may lose the discrimination in some vocabularies."
1643,256-7,"Thus, more discriminative visual vocabularies are selected by the introduced mutual information and the proposed intraclass variability balance in each category, to decrease the redundancy of the codebook."
1644,256-8,"In addition, a refined fuzzy classification strategy is presented to avoid misclassification in similar categories."
1645,256-9,"The experimental results obtained with three different types of HRI data sets confirm that the proposed method obtains classification results better than those obtained by most of the previous methods in all the large HRIs, demonstrating that the selection of representative vocabularies, the refined fuzzy classification, and the scene capture strategy are all effective in improving the performance of scene classification."
1646,257-1,Multitask learning (MTL) has recently yielded impressive results for classification of remotely sensed data due to its ability to incorporate shared information across multiple tasks.
1647,257-2,"However, it remains a challenging issue to achieve robust classification results in the case that the data are from nonlinear subspaces."
1648,257-3,"In this paper, we propose a kernel low-rank MTL (KL-MTL) method to handle multiple features from the 2-D variational mode decomposition (2-D-VMD) domain for multi-/hyperspectral classification."
1649,257-4,"On the one hand, a nonrecursive 2-D-VMD method is applied to extract various features [i.e., intrinsic mode functions (IMFs)] of the original data concurrently."
1650,257-5,"Compared with the existing 2-D empirical mode decomposition, 2-D-VMD has much stronger mathematical foundation and does not need any recursive sifting process."
1651,257-6,"On the other hand, KL-MTL is proposed for classification by taking the extracted IMFs as features of multiple tasks."
1652,257-7,"In KL-MTL, the low-rank representation formulated by nuclear norm can capture global structure of multiple tasks, while the kernel tricks are utilized for nonlinear extension of the lowrank MTL."
1653,257-8,"Moreover, the optimization problem in KL-MTL is solved by the inexact augmented Lagrangian method."
1654,257-9,"Compared with several state-of-the-art feature extraction and classification methods, the experimental results using both multi-/ hyperspectral images demonstrate that the proposed method has satisfactory classification performance."
1655,258-1,Water supplies in northeastern Brazil strongly depend on the numerous surface water reservoirs of various sizes there.
1656,258-2,"However, the seasonal and long-term water surface dynamics of these reservoirs, particularly the large number of small ones, remain inadequately known."
1657,258-3,Remote sensing techniques have shown great potentials in water bodies mapping.
1658,258-4,"Yet, the widespread presence of macrophytes in most of the reservoirs often impedes the delineation of the effective water surfaces."
1659,258-5,"Knowledge of the dynamics of the effective water surfaces in the reservoirs is essential for understanding, managing, and modelling the local and regional water resources."
1660,259-1,"Automatic updating of land use/cover change (LUCC) databases using high spatial resolution images (HSRI) is important for environmental monitoring and policy making, especially for coastal areas that connect the land and coast and that tend to change frequently."
1661,259-2,"Many object-based change detection methods are proposed, especially those combining historical LUCC with HSRI."
1662,259-3,"However, the scale parameter(s) segmenting the serial temporal images, which directly determines the average object size, is hard to choose without experts' intervention."
1663,259-4,And the samples transferred from historical LUCC also need experts' intervention to avoid insufficient or wrong samples.
1664,259-5,"With respect to the scale parameter(s) choosing, a Scale Self-Adapting Segmentation (SSAS) approach based on the exponential sampling of a scale parameter and location of the local maximum of a weighted local variance was proposed to determine the scale selection problem when segmenting images constrained by LUCC for detecting changes."
1665,259-6,"With respect to the samples transferring, Knowledge Transfer (KT), a classifier trained on historical images with LUCC and applied in the classification of updated images, was also proposed."
1666,259-7,"Comparison experiments were conducted in a coastal area of Zhujiang, China, using SPOT 5 images acquired in 2005 and 2010."
1667,259-8,The results reveal that (1) SSAS can segment images more effectively without intervention of experts. (2) KT can also reach the maximum accuracy of samples transfer without experts' intervention.
1668,259-9,"Strategy SSAS + KT would be a good choice if the temporal historical image and LUCC match, and the historical image and updated image are obtained from the same resource."
1669,26-1,"To evaluate the application potential of hyperspectral imaging, the automated spectral mapping and subpixel classification is used to classify the EO-1 satellite Hyperion data."
1670,26-2,"Once the endmembers are extracted from the conventional hyperspectral processing steps (namely, atmospheric correction, noise reduction, pixel purity, and n-dimensional visualization), these endmembers are resolved for constituent rock minerals."
1671,26-3,"Subsequently, the image is classified for mineralogy and lithology, and validated with the ground-truth data (prevailing geological map)."
1672,260-1,"Climate and land use/cover change are among the most pervasive issues facing the Southeastern United States, including the Savannah River basin in South Carolina and Georgia."
1673,260-2,Land use directly affects the natural environment across the Savannah River basin and it is important to analyze these impacts.
1674,260-3,The objectives of this study are to: 1) determine the classes and the distribution of land cover in the Savannah River basin; 2) identify the spatial and the temporal change of the land cover that occurs as a consequence of land use change in the area; and 3) discuss the potential effects of land use change in the Savannah River basin.
1675,260-4,"The land cover maps were produced using random forest supervised classification at four time periods for a total of thirteen common land cover classes with overall accuracy assessments of 79.18% (1999), 79.41% (2005), 76.04% (2009), and 76.11% (2015)."
1676,260-5,The major land use change observed was due to the deforestation and reforestation of forest areas during the entire study period.
1677,260-6,"The change detection results using the normalized difference vegetation index (NDVI) indicated that the proportion areas of the deforestation were 5.93% (1999-2005), 4.63% (2005-2009), and 3.76% (2009-2015), while the proportion areas of the reforestation were 1.57% (1999-2005), 0.44% (2005-2009), and 1.53% (2009-2015)."
1678,260-7,"These results not only indicate land use change, but also demonstrate the advantage of utilizing Google Earth Engine and the public archive database in its platform to track and monitor this change over time."
1679,261-1,Structure from Motion (SfM) represents a good low-cost alternative to generate high resolution topography where LiDAR (Light Detection and Ranging) data is scarce or unaffordable.
1680,261-2,"In this work, we demonstrate the advantages of high resolution elevation models (DEM) obtained using the SfM technique to delineate catchment boundaries and the stream network."
1681,261-3,"The SfM-based DEM was compared with LiDAR data, distributed by the Mexican Government, and a previous high resolution topographic map generated by a RTK-GPS system."
1682,261-4,Aerial images were collected on a forested ecohydrological monitoring site in northwest Mexico using a commercial grade digital camera attached to a tethered helium balloon.
1683,261-5,"Here we applied the SfM method with the removal of the vegetation, similarly to the more advance LiDAR methods."
1684,261-6,"This was achieved by adjusting the point cloud classification parameters (maximum angle, maximum distance and cell size), which to our knowledge, has not has not been reported in the available SfM literature."
1685,261-7,The SfM terrain model showed minimal differences in ground elevation in the center of the image domain (0-0.5 m) while errors increased on the edges of the domain.
1686,261-8,"The SfM model generated the largest catchment area, main and total channel length (1.07 ha, 106.1 and 223 m, respectively) while LiDAR model obtained the smallest area and main channel length (0.77 ha and 92.9 m, respectively)."
1687,261-9,"On the other hand, the SfM model had a better and accurate representation of the river network among all models evaluated due to its closest proximity to the observed GPS-tracked main channel."
1688,261-10,We concluded that the integration of low cost unmanned aerial vehicles and the SEM method is a good alternative to estimate hydro-morphological attributes in small catchments.
1689,261-11,"Furthermore, we found that high resolution SfM-based terrain models had a fairly good representation of small catchments which is useful in regions with limited data availability."
1690,261-12,The main findings of this research provide scientific value within the field of hydrological remote sensing in particular in the acquisition of high resolution topography in remote areas without access to more expensive LiDAR or survey techniques.
1691,261-13,"High resolution DEMs allow for a better characterization of catchment area size and stream network delineation which influence hydrological processes (i.e. soil moisture redistribution, runoff, ET)."
1692,262-1,Rice is one of the most important cereals in the world.
1693,262-2,"With the change of agricultural land, it is urgently neemcary to update information about rice planting areas."
1694,262-3,This study aims to map rice planting areas with a field-based approach through the integration of multi-temporal Sentinel-1A and Landsat-8 OLI data in Wuhua County of South China where has many basins and mountains.
1695,262-4,"This paper, using multi-temporal SAR and optical images, proposes a methodology for the identification of rice-planting areas."
1696,262-5,"This methodology mainly consists of SSM applied to time series SAR images for the calculation of a similarity measure, image segmentation process applied to the pan-sharpened optical image for the searching of homogenous objects, and the integration of SAR and optical data for the elimination of some speckles."
1697,262-6,"The study compares the per-pixel approach with the per field approach and the results show that the highest accuracy (91.38%) based on the field-based approach is 1.18% slightly higher than that based on the pixel-based approach for VH polarization, which is brought by eliminating speckle noise through comparing the rice maps of these two approaches."
1698,262-7,"Therefore, the integration of Sentinel-1A and Landsat-8 OLI images with a field-based approach has great potential for mapping rice or other crops' areas."
1699,263-1,"In dryland systems, the flood pulse is the driving force in system dynamics but is highly variable in flow volume and landscape inundation features."
1700,263-2,"Remote sensing can provide critical information fundamental to evaluating and forecasting flow behavior and population vulnerability; however, training and classifying an extensive time series of images is labor intensive, limiting the usefulness of these approaches in evaluating flood pulse dynamics and landscape interactions."
1701,263-3,"Here, we provide an alternative approach that relies on only one set of ""pooled"" training samples for time series image classification and analysis."
1702,263-4,We test this approach by mapping the flood pulse in a time series of moderate resolution imaging spectroradiometer (MODIS) images from the Chobe River Basin of Botswana for the years 2014 to 2016.
1703,263-5,"MODIS MOD09A1 images collected during the flooding season (February to July) were converted to Kauth-Thomas components, then sampled to form a training pool."
1704,263-6,Images were then classified using these pooled training samples.
1705,263-7,Results indicated that classification accuracies obtained using pooled training were statistically indistinguishable from classifications obtained from conventional training.
1706,263-8,"Application of the method to another year's data (2013) also yielded comparably accurate results, suggesting that the training pool method remains robust when applied to image data other than that used to create the training pool."
1707,264-1,Changes in the plant community composition due to biological invasion result in extensive changes to the ecosystem structure and functioning.
1708,264-2,Encroachment of Chir pine (Pinus roxburghii) in Banj oak (Quercus leucotrichophora) habitats in the western Himalaya is a well-established phenomenon and in due course eliminates the latter completely.
1709,264-3,Monitoring the impact of Chir pine incursion into Banj oak habitats is important for conservation and management of the oak ecosystems in western Himalaya.
1710,264-4,A remote-sensing-based classification method has been developed to precisely map and measure the potentially invaded forest areas in part of the western Himalaya.
1711,264-5,Timely identification of location and extent of invaded pine areas provides the opportunity to control the invasion.
1712,264-6,Temporal Landsat 8 OLI satellite data were used for temporal vegetation index database.
1713,264-7,"Fuzzy-based, possibilistic C-means classifier is a soft classification technique used to identify the oak habitats and its coexistence with Chir pine."
1714,264-8,The outputs were validated using field data.
1715,264-9,A total of 33.16 +/- 10.01 km(2) was estimated as the mixed class showing coexistence of Banj oak and Chir pine.
1716,264-10,The overall accuracy was found to be 0.86 +/- 0.06 from the error matrix based on the estimated area proportion.
1717,264-11,"In addition to providing a method for mapping coexistence of Banj oak and Chir pine, this study also provides information on the potential extent of the incursion of Chir pine in Banj oak forests in the western Himalaya."
1718,264-12,The critical information on potential area under invasion provides forest managers to take essential steps to minimize the incursion.
1719,265-1,Remote sensing images with high-spatial and high-temporal (HSHT) resolution are difficult to be consistently achieved with a single polar orbit satellite because of the trade-off between spatial and temporal resolution.
1720,265-2,"However, blending algorithms have been developed to synthesize HSHT images from low-spatial but high-temporal resolution images and high-spatial but low-temporal resolution images."
1721,265-3,One example is a widely used weight-function-based method known as the enhanced spatial and temporal adaptive reflectance fusion model (ESTARFM).
1722,265-4,"Similar-pixels play a key role in the prediction accuracy of this model, and their identification is influenced by the method used, the number of classes, and the moving window size."
1723,265-5,"However, influence of these parameters on the final prediction accuracy has not been thoroughly examined."
1724,265-6,"Therefore, this study assesses the accuracy of ESTARFM when similar-pixels are identified by two separate methods using different numbers of classes and moving window sizes."
1725,265-7,The results indicated that the class-image-based method outperformed the threshold-based method in most cases and the increase of moving window size generally improved the accuracy for both methods.
1726,265-8,"However, the improvement was minor and accuracy degraded in some cases if the moving window was too large."
1727,265-9,"In addition, the ESTARFM program was optimized in this study, and its computational efficiency was improved compared with previous studies."
1728,266-1,Airborne remote sensing approaches to natural gas leak detection have recently become a viable alternative to traditional in situ surveillance methods.
1729,266-2,"However, there have been few formal studies addressing the advantages and disadvantages of the various kinds of instruments typically employed for this purpose."
1730,266-3,This investigation compares the theoretical performances of differential absorption lidar systems operating near 1.65 and 3.3 mu m.
1731,266-4,The random errors affecting these instruments' respective retrievals were simulated over a range of aircraft altitudes and observed natural gas concentrations.
1732,266-5,It was found that the 3.3-mu m system is capable of measuring smaller leaks with less error than the 1.65-mu m system but only when flying at lower altitudes.
1733,266-6,"The noise floors of the 1.65- and 3.3-mu m instruments simulated in this particular analysis are similar to 0.1 and similar to 1.4 ppmm, respectively."
1734,266-7,"However, when flying at altitudes >similar to 220 m or observing leaks with concentrations >similar to 500 ppmm, the 1.65-mu m system exhibits better precision than the 3.3- mu m system."
1735,266-8,These results demonstrate that it may be more appropriate to employ one instrument over the other depending on the surveillance scenario at hand.
1736,267-1,Imaging spectroscopy is a powerful tool for mapping chemical leaf traits at the canopy level.
1737,267-2,"However, covariance with structural canopy properties is hampering the ability to predict leaf biochemical traits in structurally heterogeneous forests."
1738,267-3,"Here, we used imaging spectroscopy data to map canopy level leaf nitrogen (N) and phosphorus concentrations (P-mass) of a temperate mixed forest."
1739,267-4,"By integrating predictor variables derived from airborne laser scanning (LiDAR), capturing the biophysical complexity of the canopy, we aimed at improving predictions of N-mass and P-mass."
1740,267-5,We used partial least squares regression (PLSR) models to link community weighted means of both leaf constituents with 245 hyperspectral bands (426-2425 nm) and 38 LiDAR-derived variables.
1741,267-6,"LiDAR-derived variables improved the model's explained variances for N-mass (R-cv(2) 0.31 vs. 0.41, % RSMEcv 3.3 vs. 3.0) and P-mass (R-cv(2) 0.45 vs. 0.63, % RSMEcv 15.3 vs. 12.5)."
1742,267-7,"The predictive performances of N-mass models using hyperspectral bands only, decreased with increasing structural heterogeneity included in the calibration dataset."
1743,267-8,To test the independent contribution of canopy structure we additionally fit the models using only LiDAR-derived variables as predictors.
1744,267-9,"Resulting values ranged from 0.26 for N-mass to 0.54 for 13,P-mass indicating considerable covariation between biochemical traits and forest structural properties."
1745,267-10,"N-mass was negatively related to the spatial heterogeneity of canopy density, whereas Pm, was negatively related to stand height and to the total cover of tree canopies."
1746,267-11,"In the specific setting of this study, the importance of structural variables can be attributed to the presence of two tree species, featuring structural and biochemical properties different from co-occurring species."
1747,267-12,"Still, existing functional linkages between structure and biochemistry at the leaf and canopy level suggest that canopy structure, used as proxy, can in general support the mapping of leaf biochemistry over broad spatial extents."
1748,268-1,Mixing layer height (MLH) is a key parameter for evaluating the transport and diffusion of atmospheric pollutants in both air quality forecasting and satellite data retrieval.
1749,268-2,"However, there is a lack of methods for obtaining the nocturnal MLH."
1750,268-3,"In this study, a novel instrument named the charge-coupled device-laser aerosol detection system (CCD-LADS) was developed to study the nocturnal MLH and boundary layer structure from the surface."
1751,268-4,The system mainly includes a continuous laser and a charge-coupled device camera with a fisheye lens.
1752,268-5,Structures of atmospheric layers characterized by the CCD-LADS were compared with those measured by a ceilometer.
1753,268-6,"The heights of two atmospheric layers quantified by measurements with the CCD-LADS and the ceilometer show good agreement, with a relative difference of 5%."
1754,268-7,The results of this comparison demonstrated that the CCD-LADS is capable of distinctly identifying the nocturnal vertical structure of the atmosphere.
1755,268-8,"The advantage of the CCD-LADS in retrieving the nocturnal MLH is that the CCD-LADS can provide the boundary layer structures under 100 m, while the ceilometer and other lidar measurements cannot retrieve the atmospheric structures below that altitude."
1756,268-9,"CCD-LADS was deployed in a comprehensive field campaign measuring air pollution in the University of Chinese Academy of Sciences, located at the border between the North China Plain and Yanshan Mountain, during January 2016."
1757,268-10,The fine characteristics and patterns of the nocturnal boundary layer structures were derived with the CCD-LADS measurements.
1758,269-1,"A field campaign was conducted October 30th to November 13th, 2015 with the intention of capturing diurnal soil freeze/thaw state at multiple scales using ground measurements and remote sensing measurements."
1759,269-2,"On four of the five sampling days, we observed a significant difference between morning (frozen scenario) and afternoon (thawed scenario) ground-based measurements of the soil relative permittivity."
1760,269-3,These results were supported by an in situ soil moisture and temperature network (installed at the scale of a spaceborne passive microwave pixel) which indicated surface soil temperatures fell below 0 degrees C for the same four sampling dates.
1761,269-4,Ground-based radiometers appeared to be highly sensitive to F/T conditions of the very surface of the soil and indicated normalized polarization index (NPR) values that were below the defined freezing values during the morning sampling period on all sampling dates.
1762,269-5,"The Scanning L-band Active Passive (SLAP) instrumentation, flown over the study region, showed very good agreement with the ground-based radiometers, with freezing states observed on all four days that the airborne observations covered the fields with ground-based radiometers."
1763,269-6,"The Soil Moisture Active Passive (SMAP) satellite had morning overpasses on three of the sampling days, and indicated frozen conditions on two of those days."
1764,269-7,It was found that > 60% of the in situ network had to indicate surface temperatures below 0 degrees C before SMAP indicated freezing conditions.
1765,269-8,This was also true of the SLAP radiometer measurements.
1766,269-9,"The SMAP, SLAP and ground-based radiometer measurements all indicated freezing conditions when soil temperature sensors installed at 5 cm depth were not frozen."
1767,27-1,Flooding is the world's most costly type of natural disaster in terms of both economic losses and human causalities.
1768,27-2,"A first and essential procedure toward flood monitoring is based on identifying the area most vulnerable to flooding, which gives authorities relevant regions to focus."
1769,27-3,"In this letter, we propose several methods to perform flooding identification in high-resolution remote sensing images using deep learning."
1770,27-4,"Specifically, some proposed techniques are based upon unique networks, such as dilated and deconvolutional ones, whereas others were conceived to exploit diversity of distinct networks in order to extract the maximum performance of each classifier."
1771,27-5,The evaluation of the proposed methods was conducted in a high-resolution remote sensing data set.
1772,27-6,"Results show that the proposed algorithms outperformed the state-of-the-art baselines, providing improvements ranging from 1% to 4% in terms of the Jaccard Index."
1773,270-1,"Satellite altimetry is an important tool for monitoring water levels over oceans and inland water bodies, particularly over poorly gauged or ungauged areas."
1774,270-2,This study uses satellite altimetry (Jason-2/3 and Envisat) to derive water levels of the Great Brahmaputra River (GBR) originating from the Tibetan Plateau.
1775,270-3,"Although the width of the river channels of the Lower Brahmaputra River (LBR) is similar to 1 km, the Upper Brahmaputra River (UBR) (which is part of the Yarlung Zangbo River of China) and the Middle Brahmaputra River (MBR) located in high-mountain regions have river widths that are generally less than 400 m."
1776,270-4,This poses considerable challenges for existing retracking algorithms to obtain accurately retrieved water levels.
1777,270-5,"In this study, an improved approach for deriving water levels in high-mountain regions with complex terrain is proposed, comprising (1) an improved footprint selection and (2) an improved waveform retracking, called the 50% Threshold and Ice-1 Combined algorithm (TIC)."
1778,270-6,"It was applied to river channels of varying widths, ranging from 200 m in the UBR to more than 1 km in the LBR."
1779,270-7,Results show an increase in both the accuracy and sampling of water levels.
1780,270-8,Most of the derived water levels at 13 virtual stations (VSs) along the GBR agree reasonably well with gauged water levels (for VSs in the UBR) or published results (for VSs in the LBR).
1781,270-9,The standard deviation of the difference between the TIC-derived water levels and gauged data at the VSs ranges from 0.3 m to 0.8 m with the highest improvement percentage relative to the unretracked ranges reaching 80% in the UBR.
1782,270-10,"In addition, the developed approach increases water level sampling by reasonably demarcating the buffer zone for footprint selection, thereby generating more water levels in the time series than the published results for VSs in the LBR."
1783,270-11,"However, 3 out of the 13 virtual stations show poor performance for Envisat, primarily due to the extremely narrow river channels."
1784,270-12,"Furthermore, TIC can potentially be applied to estimate water levels near ground tracks of altimetric missions, even where there is no crossover between the river and the track."
1785,270-13,"It could also be applied to other altimetric missions, which would further contribute to monitoring water levels and potentially river discharge in high-mountain regions with narrow river channels."
1786,271-1,"Soil moisture, especially surface soil moisture (SSM), plays an important role in the development of various natural hazards that result from extreme weather events such as drought, flooding, and landslides."
1787,271-2,There have been many remote sensing methods for soil moisture retrieval based on microwave or optical thermal infrared (TIR) measurements.
1788,271-3,TIR remote sensing has been popular for SSM retrieval due to its fine spatial and temporal resolutions.
1789,271-4,"However, because of limitations in the penetration of optical TIR radiation and cloud cover, TIR methods can only be used under clear sky conditions."
1790,271-5,"Microwave SSM retrieval is based on solid physical principles, and has advantages in cases of cloud cover, but it has low spatial resolution."
1791,271-6,"For applications at the local scale, SSM data at high spatial and temporal resolutions are important, especially for agricultural management and decision support systems."
1792,271-7,"Current remote sensing measurements usually have either a high spatial resolution or a high temporal resolution, but not both."
1793,271-8,This study aims to retrieve SSM at both high spatial and temporal resolutions through the fusion of Moderate Resolution Imaging Spectroradiometer (MODIS) and Land Remote Sensing Satellite (Landsat) data.
1794,271-9,"Based on the universal triangle trapezoid, this study investigated the relationship between land surface temperature (LST) and the normalized difference vegetation index (NDVI) under different soil moisture conditions to construct an improved nonlinear model for SSM retrieval with LST and NDVI."
1795,271-10,"A case study was conducted in Iowa, in the United States (USA) (Lat: 42.2 degrees similar to 42.7 degrees, Lon: -93.6 degrees similar to-93.2 degrees), from 1 May 2016 to 31 August 2016."
1796,271-11,"Daily SSM in an agricultural area during the crop-growing season was downscaled to 120-m spatial resolution by fusing Landsat 8 with MODIS, with an R-2 of 0.5766, and RMSE from 0.0302 to 0.1124 m(3)/m(3)."
1797,272-1,"The NASA Soil Moisture Active Passive (SMAP) mission was launched on January 31st, 2015."
1798,272-2,The spacecraft was to provide high-resolution (3 km and 9 km) global soil moisture estimates at regular intervals by combining for the first time L-band radiometer and radar observations.
1799,272-3,"On July 7th, 2015, a component of the SMAP radar failed and the radar ceased operation."
1800,272-4,"However, before this occurred the mission was able to collect and process similar to 2.5 months of the SMAP high-resolution active-passive soil moisture data (L2SMAP) that coincided with the Northern Hemisphere's vegetation green-up and crop growth season."
1801,272-5,"In this study, we evaluate the SMAP high resolution soil moisture product derived from several alternative algorithms against in situ data from core calibration and validation sites (CVS), and sparse networks."
1802,272-6,The baseline algorithm had the best comparison statistics against the CVS and sparse networks.
1803,272-7,The overall unbiased root-mean-square-difference is close to the 0.04 m(3)/m(3) the SMAP mission requirement.
1804,272-8,A 3 km spatial resolution soil moisture product was also examined.
1805,272-9,This product had an unbiased root-mean-square-difference of similar to 0.053 m(3)/m(3).
1806,272-10,The SMAP L2SMAP product for similar to 2.5 months is now validated for use in geophysical applications and research and available to the public through the NASA Distributed Active Archive Center (DAAC) at the National Snow and Ice Data Center (NSIDC).
1807,272-11,"The L2SMAP product is packaged with the geo-coordinates, acquisition times, and all requisite ancillary information."
1808,272-12,"Although limited in duration, SMAP has clearly demonstrated the potential of using a combined L-band radar-radiometer for proving high spatial resolution and accurate global soil moisture."
1809,273-1,"While remote sensing has increasingly been applied to estimate a biodiversity directly through optical diversity, there is a need to better understand the mechanisms behind the optical diversity-biodiversity relationship."
1810,273-2,"Here, we examined the relative contributions of species richness, evenness, and composition to the spectral reflectance, and consider factors confounding the remote estimation of species diversity in a prairie ecosystem experiment at Cedar Creek Ecosystem Science Reserve, Minnesota."
1811,273-3,"We collected hyperspectral reflectance of 16 prairie species using a tram-mounted imaging spectrometer, and a full-range field spectrometer with a leaf clip, and simulated plot-level images from both instruments with different species richness, evenness and composition."
1812,273-4,"Two optical diversity metrics were explored: the coefficient of variation (CV) of spectral reflectance in space and classified species derived from Partial Least Squares Discriminant Analysis (PLS-DA), a spectral classification method."
1813,273-5,Both optical diversity metrics (CV and PLS-DA classified species) were affected by species richness and evenness.
1814,273-6,"Diversity metrics that combined species richness and evenness together ((e.g, Shannon's index)) were more strongly correlated with optical diversity than either metric alone."
1815,273-7,"Image-derived data were influenced by both leaf traits and canopy structure and showed larger spectral variability than leaf clip data, indicating that sampling methods influence optical diversity."
1816,273-8,"Leaf and canopy traits both contributed to optical diversity, sometimes in complex or contradictory ways."
1817,273-9,"Large within-species variation sometimes confounded biodiversity estimation from optical diversity, and a single species markedly altered the optical-biodiversity relationship."
1818,273-10,"Biodiversity estimation from CV was strongly influenced by soil background, while estimation from PLS-DA classified species was not sensitive to soil background."
1819,273-11,These findings are consistent with recent empirical studies and demonstrate that modeling approaches can be used to explore effects of spatial scale and guide regional studies of biodiversity estimation using high spatial and spectral resolution remote sensing.
1820,274-1,An effective planning and management to deal with potential impacts of drought requires accurate estimation and analysis of this natural complex phenomenon.
1821,274-2,"Application of new fusion approaches using high-resolution satellite-based products, unlike ground-based observations, can provide accurate drought analysis."
1822,274-3,This study examines three advanced fusion-based methodologies including Ordered Weighted Averaged (OWA) approach based on ORNESS weighting method (ORNESS-OWA) and ORLIKE weighting method (ORLIKE-OWA) as well as K-nearest neighbors algorithm (KNN) to fuse estimations by five individual estimator models using different remotely sensed data products.
1823,274-4,"The precipitation data from Global Precipitation Climatology Project (GPCP), CPC Merged Analysis of Precipitation (CMAP), CICS High-Resolution Optimal Interpolation Microwave Precipitation from Satellites (CHOMPS), Precipitation Estimation from Remotely Sensed Information using Artificial Neural Networks-Climate Data Record (PERSIANN-CDR), Tropical Rainfall Measuring Mission (TRMM), The second Modern-Era Retrospective analysis for Research and Applications (MERRA-2) and Global Land Data Assimilation System Version-2 (GLDAS-2) products is utilized in estimating nonparametric-SPI as a meteorological drought index versus ground-based observations analysis."
1824,274-5,"To achieve more accurate drought estimation, ground-based observations are classified in different clusters based on K-means clustering algorithm."
1825,274-6,"Five individual Artificial Intelligence (AI) models including Multi-Layer Perceptron (MLP), Adaptive Neuro-Fuzzy Inference System (ANFIS), M5P model tree, Group Method of Data Handling (GMDH) and Support Vector Regression (SVR) are developed for each cluster and their best results are used in fusion process."
1826,274-7,"In addition, the Genetic Algorithm (GA) optimization model is utilized to determine optimal weights in weighting methods."
1827,274-8,"Estimation performance of all models are evaluated using statistical error indices of Mean Absolute Relative Error (MARE), Root Mean Square Error (RMSE), Mean Absolute Error (MAE) and coefficient of determination (R-2)."
1828,274-9,Application of proposed methodology is verified over Fars province in Iran and the results are compared.
1829,274-10,Results showed that ORNESS-OWA method with lowest estimation error (MARE of 2.51% and R-2 of 95%) had the superb performance in comparison with all other individual AI and fusion-based models.
1830,274-11,"Also, the proposed framework based on remotely sensed precipitation data and fusion-based models demonstrated an effective proficiency in drought estimation."
1831,275-1,"In this study, the segmented particle swarm optimization (SPSO) algorithm and the concepts of the gradient boosting decision tree algorithm (GBDT) were combined to propose the SPSO adaptive neural network (SANN) method."
1832,275-2,The purpose of this method is to address the inadequacies of the traditional basis function (BP) and radial basis function (RBF) neural networks when solving problems that involve local optima and overfitting.
1833,275-3,"Experimental results indicated that, overall, the SANN method is accurate in remote-sensing estimations of aquatic vegetation biomass."
1834,275-4,"However, accuracies of estimations were unsatisfactory for certain indicators and sessions when data was taken."
1835,275-5,"The estimations were analyzed using three sets of indicators: (i) root mean square error, average relative error, and total relative error; (ii) correlation coefficient and coefficient of determination, and their scatter plots; and (iii) relative error values and their distributions."
1836,275-6,The results clearly showed that the SANN method was superior to the BP neural network as well as the stepwise multiple linear regression analysis (SR).
1837,275-7,"However, when the relative errors in biomass estimations by the other two methods were low, the advantages of the SANN method were less pronounced."
1838,275-8,"This was particularly true when the relative errors were < 30%, in which case SANN was only marginally better than the other two methods."
1839,276-1,Spatial and temporal information on the structural and chemical properties of tropical forest canopies are key to understanding ecosystem processes.
1840,276-2,"However, such information is usually limited to field studies performed at the plot level (similar to 1 ha)."
1841,276-3,The combination of imaging spectroscopy with physically based radiative transfer (RT) models holds great promise for generalizing and extrapolating insights from plot-based studies to whole landscapes.
1842,276-4,"Here, we tested the capacity of a simplified 3D RT approach to retrieve the structural and chemical traits of individual tree crowns (ITCs) from a highly diverse tropical forest."
1843,276-5,We first produced two datasets called measured and simulated.
1844,276-6,The measured dataset was composed of ITC reflectance extracted from sunlit imaging spectroscopy pixels.
1845,276-7,The simulated dataset was produced using a look-up-table approach and the discrete anisotropic radiative transfer (DART) model.
1846,276-8,We then compared the simulated and measured reflectances of ITCs in terms of shape difference by computing the spectral angle.
1847,276-9,The results showed small disagreements between the simulated and measured reflectances.
1848,276-10,"Such differences impacted neither the spectral variability nor the spectral regions recognized as useful for species discrimination, showing that the spectral angle was a suitable measure of spectral similarity."
1849,276-11,"Simulation robustness was assessed by comparing model parameters obtained by inversion to imaging spectroscopy vegetation indices and the proportion of non-photosynthetic vegetation (NPV), green photosynthetic vegetation (GV) and shade estimated within ITCs."
1850,276-12,"DART canopy structural parameters were related to NPV (R-2 = 0.71), GV (R-2 = 0.78) and shade (R-2 = 0.55)."
1851,276-13,"DART canopy foliar parameters such as chlorophyll and carotenoids were related to the ratio of TCARI/OSAVI (R-2 = 0.80) indices and the simple ratio between reflectances at 515 nm and 570 nm (R-515/R-570) (R-2 = 0.54), respectively."
1852,276-14,"Species-related differences in NPV, GV and shade were explained by variations in crown architectural characteristics."
1853,276-15,The simulation framework employed in this study can be applied to retrieve structural and chemical traits of ITCs from other areas in which high-resolution imaging spectroscopy data are available.
1854,277-1,The xanthophyll cycle regulates the energy flow to photosynthetic reaction centres of plant leaves.
1855,277-2,Changes in the de-epoxidation state (DEPS) of xanthophyll cycle pigments can be observed as changes in the leaf absorption of light with wavelengths between 500 to 570 nm.
1856,277-3,"These spectral changes can be a good remote sensing indicator of the photosynthetic efficiency, and are traditionally quantified with a two-band physiologically based optical index, the Photochemical Reflectance Index (PRI)."
1857,277-4,"In this paper, we present an extension of the plant leaf radiative transfer model Fluspect (Fluspect-CX) that reproduces the spectral changes in a wide band of green reflectance: a radiative transfer analogy to the PRI."
1858,277-5,"The idea of Fluspect-CX is to use in vivo specific absorption coefficients for two extreme states of carotenoids, representing the two extremes of the xanthophyll de-epoxidation, and to describe the intermediate states as a linear mixture of these two states."
1859,277-6,The 'photochemical reflectance parameter' (C-x) quantifies the relative proportion of the two states.
1860,277-7,"Fluspect-CX simulates leaf chlorophyll fluorescence (ChlF) excitation-emission matrices, as well as reflectance (R) and transmittance (7) spectra as a function of leaf structure, pigment contents and C."
1861,277-8,We describe the calibration of the model and test its performance using various experimental datasets.
1862,277-9,"Furthermore, we retrieved C-x from optical measurements of various datasets."
1863,277-10,"The retrieved C-x correlates well with xanthophyll DEPS (R-2 = 0.57), as well with non-photochemical quenching (NPQ) of fluorescence (R-2 = 0.78)."
1864,277-11,The correlation with NPQ enabled us to incorporate Fluspect-CX in the model SCOPE to scale the processes to the canopy level.
1865,277-12,"Introducing the dynamic green reflectance into a radiative transfer model provides new means to study chlorophyll fluorescence and PRI dynamics on leaf and canopy scales, which is crucial for the remote sensing."
1866,278-1,Crop sowing date information is important for driving crop models and estimating crop yield.
1867,278-2,"However, data on sowing dates are often scarce for both developed and developing countries, making remote sensing approaches to map sowing date an attractive approach."
1868,278-3,Yet the relative merits of different satellite sensors and metrics to estimate sowing date have not been well studied.
1869,278-4,"We assess and compare the accuracies and uncertainties of satellite-derived sowing date estimates using different metrics (inflection point and threshold approaches) and satellite sensors that cover the range in the electromagnetic spectrum (optical, fluorescence, and radar)."
1870,278-5,"We validate these estimates using a county-level dataset derived from area-weighted field-level reported sowing dates for maize and soybean in the US states of Iowa, Illinois, and Indiana, and conduct our analysis both at the county level and at the aggregated tri-state region."
1871,278-6,"We specifically use the Enhanced Vegetation Index (EVI) from Moderate Resolution Imaging Spectroradiometer (MODIS), solar-induced fluorescence (SIF) from Global Ozone Monitoring Experiment-2 (GOME-2) and Ku-band backscattering from QuikSCAT (dB)."
1872,278-7,"We also compare the inflection point method and the threshold approach that defines sowing date as a specific threshold value (10%, 30% and 50%) between the minimum and maximum value in a logistic-curve smoothed phonology."
1873,278-8,"We find that satellite-based estimate of sowing dates from all methods and sensors shows a wide range of predictive power at the county level, with R-2 ranging between 0.15 and 0.90, with significant variation across sensors."
1874,278-9,"SIF has excellent prediction for more counties than the other sensors, but EVI performs more consistently with moderate to good prediction for the greatest bulk of counties among all sensors, while dB's predicted sowing dates are negatively correlated with observed dates for most counties."
1875,278-10,"For each sensor, aggregation to the regional level produces time series of predicted sowing dates that more successfully capture linear time trends and inter-annual variability."
1876,278-11,Adjusting for spring temperatures and crop areal coverage significantly improves the accuracies of the estimated sowing dates at both the county and regional scales.
1877,278-12,"Among the combinations of the three satellite products and four metrics, we find using SIF and/or EVI and the 30% threshold metric have the highest accuracies in terms of reproducing inter-annual variability and minimizing RMSE at regional scales."
1878,278-13,"This study provides a systematic assessment of using different satellite sensors and metrics to estimate county- to regional scale crop sowing dates, which has important implications for mapping sowing date in data-limited regions across the globe."
1879,279-1,"Harmful algal blooms (HABs) present a potential danger for human health and commercial activities, especially in coastal regions."
1880,279-2,Observing systems increasingly rely on remote sensors to monitor and possibly predict the locations and intensity of such blooms.
1881,279-3,"Here we present a novel approach for detecting HABs of Alexandrium fundyense in the Bay of Fundy, Canada."
1882,279-4,"A. fundyense is considered toxic for individuals who consume shellfish when cell abundances adjacent to shellfish harvesting areas are as low as 200 cells.L-1, making it difficult to use direct remote sensing techniques to assess the threat in the early stages of the development of the bloom."
1883,279-5,"Using in situ A. fundyense cell abundance measurements, together with satellite observations of sea-surface temperature and the occurrence of diatom-dominated phytoplankton populations, a warning system was developed based on three levels of alerts: green (low abundance of A. fundyense), orange (possible threat of A. fundyense) and red (high probability of A. fundyense concentrations that would result in shellfish toxicity above safe levels for human consumption)."
1884,279-6,"Combined information on diatom phenology and variations in sea-surface temperature are key to the timing of A. fundyense blooms: our data reveal that the termination of the diatom spring bloom, associated with the warming of the water, can trigger an increase in A. fundyense cell abundance."
1885,279-7,The objective criteria for a HAB warning system was developed and tested in the Bay of Fundy using two different datasets: one to develop the algorithm (data collected between 1998 and 2007) and one to assess its performance (data collected in 2011).
1886,279-8,The warning system is based on the cautionary principle that a false negative (warning not issued when it should have been) is far more serious than a false positive (warning issued when it should not have been).
1887,279-9,"The overall success of the algorithm when tested on the validation dataset is about 70% using a threshold of 150 A. fundyense cells.L-1, with a low occurrence of false negative red alerts (< 8%)."
1888,279-10,"The satellite data -based warning can be used to optimize an in situ monitoring system, which can be designed to be more intensive when the warning status is orange or red."
1889,279-11,This study demonstrates that combined satellite information on phytoplankton phonology and sea-surface temperature can help predict low abundances of toxic A. fundyense cells.
1890,279-12,It also highlights the importance of an integrated approach combining satellite and in situ observations to monitor HABs.
1891,28-1,Accurate land cover classification and detection of objects in high-resolution electro-optical remote sensing imagery (RSI) have long been a challenging task.
1892,28-2,"Recently, important new benchmark data sets have been released which are suitable for land cover classification and object detection research."
1893,28-3,"Here, we present state-of-the-art results for four benchmark data sets using a variety of deep convolutional neural networks (DCNN) and multiple network fusion techniques."
1894,28-4,"We achieve 99.70%, 99.66%, 97.74%, and 97.30% classification accuracies on the PatternNet, RSI-CB256, aerial image, and RESISC-45 data sets, respectively, using the Choquet integral with a novel data-driven optimization method presented in this letter."
1895,28-5,The relative reduction in classification errors achieved by this data driven optimization is 25%-45% compared with the single best DCNN results.
1896,280-1,The Optical TRApezoid Model (OPTRAM) has recently been proposed for estimation of soil moisture using only optical remote sensing data.
1897,280-2,"The model relies on a physical linear relationship between the soil moisture content and shortwave infrared transformed reflectance (SIR) and can be parameterized universally (i.e., a single calibration for a given area) based on the pixel distribution within the STR-Normalized Difference Vegetation Index (NDVI) trapezoidal space."
1898,280-3,"The main motivation for this study was to evaluate how the universal parameterization of OPTRAM works for long periods of time (e.g., several decades)."
1899,280-4,This is especially relevant for uncovering the soil moisture and agricultural drought history in response to climate change in different regions.
1900,280-5,"In this study, MODIS satellite observations from 2001 to 2017 were acquired and used for the analysis."
1901,280-6,"Cosmic ray neutron (CRN) soil moisture data, collected with the Cosmic-ray Soil Moisture Observing System (COSMOS) at five different sites in the U.S. covering diverse climates, soil types, and land covers, were applied for evaluation of the MODIS-OPTRAM-based soil moisture estimates."
1902,280-7,"The OPTRAM soil moisture estimates were further compared to the Soil Moisture Active and Passive (SMAP) (L-band), the Soil Moisture Ocean Salinity (SMOS) (L band), and the Advanced AScatterometer (ASCAT) (C-band) soil moisture retrievals."
1903,280-8,OPTRAM soil moisture data were also analyzed for potential monitoring of agricultural drought through comparison of the OPTRAM-based Soil Water Deficit Index (OPTRAM-SWDI) with the widely-applied Crop Moisture Index (CMI).
1904,280-9,"Evaluation results indicate that OPTRAM-based soil moisture estimates provide overall unbiased RMSE and R between 0.050 and 0.085 cm(3) cm(-3) and 0.10 to 0.70, respectively, for all investigated sites."
1905,280-10,"The performance of OPTRAM is comparable with the ASCAT retrievals, but slightly less accurate than SMAP and SMOS."
1906,280-11,OPTRAM and the three microvave satellites captured CRN soil moisture temporal dynamics very well for all five investigated sites.
1907,280-12,A close agreement was observed between the OPTRAM-SWDI and CMI drought indices for most selected sites.
1908,280-13,"In conclusion, OPTRAM can estimate temporal soil moisture dynamics with reasonable accuracy for a range of climatic conditions (semi-arid to humid), soil types, and land covers, and can potentially be applied for agricultural drought monitoring."
1909,281-1,"As an important component of the Earth's ecosystem, soil moisture plays a vital role in the global water cycle and serves as an important parameter in the study of hydrology, meteorology, and agroecology."
1910,281-2,"Based on the energy balance theory of underlying surface, the atmospheric temperature data recorded by an automatic weather station as well as unmanned aerial vehicle (UAV)-borne thermal infrared and multispectral remote-sensing data were used to establish inversion models of relative soil moisture at different depths based on remote-sensing UAV data and date from near-ground quadrats, respectively."
1911,281-3,Spatial differences and data accuracy verification were then performed using the 2017 spring wheat moisture data as a control.
1912,281-4,The results showed that: (1) the relative moisture of farmland soil can be effectively estimated using the proposed soil moisture inversion model.
1913,281-5,"In terrestrial ecosystems, the ratio of actual to potential evapotranspiration, which is often used to characterize potential drought levels, is linearly correlated to soil moisture at different depths; (2) during the inversion of farmland soil moisture, the UAV-based observation method is superior to the near-ground quadrat observation method in both efficiency and accuracy."
1914,281-6,"In addition, the relative soil moisture estimation model based on UAV data has a high accuracy, with R-2 reaching 0.629, and a root mean square error (RMSE) of <0.100; and (3) the number and size of quadrats are important factors affecting the inversion accuracy."
1915,281-7,The data collected by the UAVs covered a wide range and had high spatial matching degree at the field scale.
1916,281-8,"Especially, during estimation of the relative moisture of surface soil (0 to 10 and 0 to 20 cm), the linear fitting between the inversion model based on UAV data and the measured value was optimal."
1917,281-9,"The error was minimal (RMSE <0.07) and R-2 was >0.714, so this method is more suitable for estimating and dynamically monitoring relative soil moisture of farmland at the field scale."
1918,282-1,"Over the past 20 years, hyperspectral microscopy has grown into a robust field of analysis for a number of applications."
1919,282-2,The visible to near-infrared (VNIR; 400 to 1000 nm) region of the spectrum has demonstrated utility for the characterization of healthy and diseased tissue and of biomolecular indicators at the cellular level.
1920,282-3,"Here, we describe the development of a hyperspectral imaging (HSI) microscope that is aimed at material characterization to complement traditional stand-off, earth remote sensing with hyperspectral sensors."
1921,282-4,We combine commercial off the shelf technology to build an HSI microscope to collect spectral data with illumination provided by a tunable laser.
1922,282-5,Hyperspectral imaging microscopy (HIM) facilitates detailed examination of target materials at the subcentimeter spatial scale.
1923,282-6,"The custom-built, laser illumination HSI microscope covers the NIR to shortwave infrared (NIR/SWIR; 900 to 2500 nm) solar-reflected spectral range."
1924,282-7,It is combined with a separate VNIR sensor (400 to 900 nm) that utilizes quartz-tungsten-halogen lamps for illumination.
1925,282-8,"The combined sensors provide a means to collect >10,000 s of spectra in the full VNIR/SWIR spectral range from both pure substances and precisely engineered linear and nonlinear mixtures."
1926,282-9,The large abundance of spectra allows for a more detailed understanding of the variability and multivariate probability distributions of spectral signatures.
1927,282-10,"This additional information aids in understanding the variability observed in ground truth spectra collected from portable spectrometers, and it greatly enhances sample description and metadata content."
1928,282-11,"In addition, HIM data cubes can serve as proxies, as ""microscenes,"" for systems engineering applications such as trade studies for HSI acquired by air- and space-borne sensors."
1929,283-1,The hills of Uttarakhand witness forest fire every year during the summer season and the number of these fire events is reported to have increased due to increased anthropogenic disturbances as well as changes in climate.
1930,283-2,These fires cause significant damage to the natural resources which can be mapped and monitored using satellite images by virtue of its synoptic coverage of the landscape and near real time monitoring.
1931,283-3,This study presents burnt area assessment caused by the fire episode of April 2016 to the forest vegetation.
1932,283-4,"Digital classification of satellite images was done to extract the burnt area which was found to be 3774.14 km(2), representing 15.28% of the total forest area of the state."
1933,283-5,"It also gives an account of cumulative progression of forest fire in Uttarakhand using satellite images of three dates viz. 23rd, 27th May and 2nd June, 2016."
1934,283-6,"Results were analyzed at district, administrative and forest division level using overlay analysis."
1935,283-7,"Separate area statistics were given for different categories of biological richness, forest types and protected areas affected by forest fire."
1936,283-8,The burnt area assessment can be used in mitigation planning to prevent drastic ecological impacts of the forest fire on the landscape.
1937,284-1,UAVs are fast emerging as a remote sensing platform to complement satellite based remote sensing.
1938,284-2,"Agriculture and ecology is one of the important applications of UAV remote sensing, also known as low altitude remote sensing (LARS)."
1939,284-3,"This work demonstrates the use and potential of LARS in agriculture, particularly small holder open field agriculture."
1940,284-4,Two UAVs are used for remote sensing.
1941,284-5,The first UAV is a fixed wing aircraft with a high spatial resolution visible spectrum also known as RGB camera as a payload.
1942,284-6,The second UAV is a quadrotor UAV with an RGB camera interfaced to an on-board single board computer as the payload.
1943,284-7,LARS was carried out to acquire aerial high spatial resolution RGB images of different farms.
1944,284-8,"Spectral-spatial classification of high spatial resolution RGB images for detection, delineation and counting of tree crowns in the image is presented."
1945,284-9,"Supervised classification is carried out using extreme learning machine (ELM), a single hidden layer feed forward network neural network classifier."
1946,284-10,ELM was modelled for RGB values as input feature vectors and binary (tree and non-tree pixels) output class.
1947,284-11,"Due to similarities in spectral intensities, some of the non-tree pixels were classified as tree pixels and in order to remove them, spatial classification was performed on the image."
1948,284-12,Spatial classification was carried out using thresholded geometrical property filtering techniques.
1949,284-13,Threshold values chosen for carrying out spatial classification were analysed to obtain optimal values.
1950,284-14,"Finally in the delineation and counting, the connected tree crowns were segmented using Watershed algorithm performed on the image after marking individual tree crowns using Distance Transform method."
1951,284-15,"Five representative UAV images captured at different altitudes with different crowns of banana plant, mango trees and coconut trees were used to demonstrate the performance of the proposed method."
1952,284-16,The performance was compared with the traditional KMeans spectral-spatial method of clustering.
1953,284-17,Results and comparison of performance parameters of KMeans spectral-spatial and ELM spectral-spatial classification methods are presented.
1954,284-18,Results indicate that ELM performed better than KMeans.
1955,285-1,"With recent advances in polarimetry, Synthetic Aperture Radar (SAR) with Hybrid-polarity architecture, a demonstration of compact polarimetry enabled larger swath coverage, reduced PRF and SAR system complexity as compared to fully polarimetric systems."
1956,285-2,"The first Hybrid Polarimetric Space-borne SAR in Earth Observation orbit, India's Radar Imaging Satellite (RISAT-1) is a new-fangled gateway to remote sensing user community for land and oceanic applications."
1957,285-3,"In response to a right-circular polarized transmitted signal, based on the derived stokes vectors, Stokes parameters are estimated to produce several useful quantitative measures for generating polarimetric decomposed image. m-delta, m-chi and m-alpha polarimetric decomposition methods along with suitable weighting functions in terms of three principal components are implemented which maps Stokes parameters to RGB image space for representing odd bounce, even bounce and volume scattering targets."
1958,285-4,"Various RISAT-1 Hybrid Fine Resolution Stripmap Single-Look Complex SAR datasets acquired over deployed corner reflectors at calibration site, Shadnagar have been considered over which different hybrid polarimetric decomposition techniques are implemented using in-house developed software."
1959,285-5,Further analysis produced encouraging results with standard point targets like dihedral and trihedral corner reflectors against distributed targets in the same scene to demonstrate the scattering mechanisms as per their characteristics when interacted with a polarized signal were presented in this paper.
1960,286-1,"Automatic urban land cover classification is a fundamental problem in remote sensing, e.g., for environmental monitoring."
1961,286-2,"The problem is highly challenging, as classes generally have high interclass and low intraclass variances."
1962,286-3,Techniques to improve urban land cover classification performance in remote sensing include fusion of data from different sensors with different data modalities.
1963,286-4,"However, such techniques require all modalities to be available to the classifier in the decision-making process, i.e., at test time, as well as in training."
1964,286-5,"If a data modality is missing at test time, current state-of-the-art approaches have in general no procedure available for exploiting information from these modalities."
1965,286-6,This represents a waste of potentially useful information.
1966,286-7,We propose as a remedy a convolutional neural network (CNN) architecture for urban land cover classification which is able to embed all available training modalities in the so-called hallucination network.
1967,286-8,"The network will in effect replace missing data modalities in the test phase, enabling fusion capabilities even when data modalities are missing in testing."
1968,286-9,We demonstrate the method using two datasets consisting of optical and digital surface model (DSM) images.
1969,286-10,We simulate missing modalities by assuming that DSM images are missing during testing.
1970,286-11,Our method outperforms both standard CNNs trained only on optical images as well as an ensemble of two standard CNNs.
1971,286-12,We further evaluate the potential of our method to handle situations where only some DSM images are missing during testing.
1972,286-13,"Overall, we show that we can clearly exploit training time information of the missing modality during testing."
1973,287-1,This paper focuses on unsupervised clustering of hyperspectral pixels whose intensity may not be available across certain spectral bands.
1974,287-2,The presence of statistical correlations among pixels that contain data originating from the same material is exploited here to develop a novel regularized correlation analysis framework to perform clustering.
1975,287-3,Kernel learning is integrated in a regularized correlations framework to exploit nonlinear dependencies of pixels acquiring information about similar materials.
1976,287-4,An effective technique is proposed to select the kernel mapping parameters and form pertinent kernel covariance matrices by proper weighted-averaging that takes into account the information content across the available spectral bands.
1977,287-5,The novel correlations framework will return proper sparse clustering matrices whose nonzero entries point to the correlated pixels.
1978,287-6,These matrices will be obtained via a minimization formulation that will be solved via computationally efficient subgradient descent iterations.
1979,287-7,"The novel correlations formulation is applied in small-size pixel patches of the original hyperspectral image, while recursively bigger size patches are built that contain information about the same materials."
1980,287-8,"Extensive numerical tests on real hyperspectral images reveal that the proposed approach, in spite of being unsupervised, can outperform existing supervised and unsupervised techniques especially in the presence of missing pixels."
1981,288-1,"Daily evapotranspiration (ET) is of great significance among various practical applications including water management, drought monitoring, and climate change study."
1982,288-2,The ET estimations from remotely sensed models are usually instantaneous values.
1983,288-3,Various upscaling methods have been developed to extrapolate the instantaneous ET to daily scale.
1984,288-4,"In the applications of these methods, the accuracy of daily ET estimation relies on both the accuracy of instantaneous ET calculation and the upscaling methods."
1985,288-5,"This paper used the decoupling model to estimate daily ET directly, according to the constancy of the decoupling coefficient (Omega) in the model in a diurnal cycle, without the calculation of instantaneous ET."
1986,288-6,The estimated daily ET was compared with the Eddy covariance measurements which were corrected by the Bowen ratio method to close the energy imbalances.
1987,288-7,"The result from field data alone showed that the coefficient of determination (R-2) of daily ET estimation was 0.860, with a root-mean-square error (RMSE) of 18.2 W/m(2), and a bias of -4.7 W/m(2)."
1988,288-8,"Combining MODIS data and field data, the estimated daily ET had a R2 of 0.860, a RMSE of 21.6 W/m(2), and a bias of -5.0 W/m(2)."
1989,288-9,"Therefore, it is feasible and effective to obtain daily ET using remote-sensing based instantaneous Omega to replace daily value in the decoupling model."
1990,289-1,Monitoring and measuring the conditions of the earth surface play important role in the domain of global change research.
1991,289-2,"In this direction, various methodologies exist for land cover classification of remote sensing images."
1992,289-3,"Neural network (NN) is one such system that has the ability to classify land cover of remote sensing images, but most often its accuracy deteriorates with the level of uncertainty."
1993,289-4,"Granular NN (GNN), that incorporates information granulation operation to NN, is one of the solutions to address this issue."
1994,289-5,"However, complexity of the remote sensing dataset demands for a GNN with changeable granular structure (shape and size of granules) based on the requirement."
1995,289-6,"In this study, our objective is to develop a GNN with adaptive granular structure for the classification of remote sensing images."
1996,289-7,An architecture of this adaptive GNN (AGNN) evolves according to the information present in the incoming labeled pixels.
1997,289-8,"As a result, the AGNN improves the classification performance compared to other similar models."
1998,289-9,Performance of the model has been tested with hyperspectral and multispectral remote sensing images.
1999,289-10,"Superiority of the proposed model to other similar methods has been verified with performance measurement metrics, such as overall accuracy, users accuracy, producers accuracy, dispersion score, and kappa coefficient."
2000,29-1,"Information about ice thickness and subglacial topography is a key element for ice dynamics modeling and, consequently, for better understanding of current response of glaciers to climatic forcing."
2001,29-2,"While there has been a substantial progress in the measurements of glacial surface, ice thickness measurements still suffer from limited coverage and strong interpolation."
2002,29-3,"Furthermore, there are some glaciated areas where typical remote sensing techniques provide only limited data due to unfavorable climatic conditions and steep topography."
2003,29-4,A perfect example of such a feature is icefalls dominating landscapes of the maritime Antarctic.
2004,29-5,"In order to close that gap, this letter presents a simple method of inferring the subglacial topography based on repeated terrestrial laser scanning of the ice surface and inverse shallow ice approximation modeling."
2005,29-6,"Emerald Icefalls, King George Island, were surveyed twice within eight-day period, allowing to derive ice surface velocity field by feature tracking analysis and to estimate ice thickness and the subglacial topography."
2006,29-7,"Calculated ice thickness is low, with the mean value of 72 +/- 18 m."
2007,29-8,"Therefore, in line with former studies, the overall ice flux of Emerald Icefalls is small despite their relatively high surface ice flow velocities."
2008,290-1,This paper analyzes and compares multiple techniques for estimating the mean square slope (MSS) of surface waves during Hurricane Ike in the Gulf of Mexico and studiesthe correlation of the MSS estimates with wind speed measurements along the same tracks.
2009,290-2,"Three separate instrumentscollected measurements in parallel, including a GPS reflectometry (GPS-R) receiver, a stepped frequency microwave radiometer (SFMR), and a wideswath radar altimeter (WSRA)."
2010,290-3,These datasets were used to study the correlation between the flight level and near-surface wind and MSS during Hurricane Ike in 2008.
2011,290-4,"The GPS-R, SFMR, and WSRA instruments recorded temporally and spatially coincident data during two passes over the hurricane eye."
2012,290-5,"This paper estimates the ocean surface MSS using GPS-R for two eye transects using: a least squares model fitting technique, the reflected signal waveform width, and an integration of the reflected signals in an area around the peak."
2013,290-6,"Subsequently, the correlations between the GPS-R and WSRA MSS estimates and the SFMR wind speed estimates are compared to reveal regions of high and low surface MSS to wind speed correlation."
2014,290-7,"Finally, a relationship between wind and MSS was derived from the GPS-R and SFMR data and is compared to existing MSS/wind models, including the results obtained by Katzberg et al. for hurricane conditions."
2015,291-1,Surface reflectance can be derived from satellite measurements for the top of atmosphere and provides an important dataset for monitoring land change reliably.
2016,291-2,"In this study, the Sentinel-2A surface reflectance was generated using the Sentinel-2 atmospheric correction (Sen2Cor) processor."
2017,291-3,"To evaluate this dataset, surface data at 40 sites of the aerosol robotic network over North America from January 2016 to August 2017 were collected and processed."
2018,291-4,The surface reflectance reference was derived from the second simulation of the satellite signal in the solar spectrum-vector (6SV) code.
2019,291-5,"The aerosol optical thickness (AOT), water vapor, surface reflectance, and three spectral indices generated by Sen2Cor were evaluated using the metrics including the accuracy, precision, and uncertainty (A, P, and U)."
2020,291-6,"The results show that due to the limitations of Sen2Cor aerosol retrieval algorithm, the Sentinel-2A AOT was significantly overestimated, with the relative accuracy over 160%."
2021,291-7,"The Sen2Cor surface reflectance is generally overestimated, especially for the bright pixels, except for the cirrus band."
2022,291-8,"For the 12 Sentinel-2A bands, the mean values of relative A, P, and U are 4.15%, 13.44%, and 14.92%, respectively."
2023,291-9,"Among the three spectral indices, the normalized difference vegetation index performs best, with a correlation coefficient of 0.973 against the surface data."
2024,291-10,"Furthermore, the Sen2Cor surface reflectance was compared with other satellite products."
2025,291-11,The mean correlation coefficient between Sentinel-2A and Landsat 8 surface reflectance is found to be 0.761.
2026,291-12,This study suggests that a better AOT retrieval is critical for improvement of Sen2Cor in the future.
2027,292-1,The empirical line (EL) calibration method is commonly used for atmospheric correction of remotely sensed spectral images and recovery of surface reflectance.
2028,292-2,The current EL-based methods are applicable to calibrate only single images.
2029,292-3,"Therefore, the use of the EL calibration is impractical for imaging campaigns, where many (partially overlapped) images are acquired to cover a large area."
2030,292-4,"In addition, the EL results are unconstrained and an undesired reflectance with negative values or larger than 100% can be obtained."
2031,292-5,"In this paper, we use the standard EL model to formulate a new generalized empirical line (GEL) model."
2032,292-6,"Based on the GEL, we present a novel method for simultaneous and constrained calibration of multiple images."
2033,292-7,This new method allows for calibration through multiple image constrained empirical line (MIcEL) and three additional calibration modes.
2034,292-8,"Given a set of images, we use the available ground targets and automatically extracted tie points between overlapping images to calibrate all the images in the set simultaneously."
2035,292-9,"Quantitative and visual assessments of the proposed method were carried out relatively to the off-the-shelf method quick atmospheric correction (QUAC), using real hyperspectral images and field measurements."
2036,292-10,The results clearly show the superiority of MIcEL with respect to the minimization of the difference between the reflectance values of the same object in different overlapping images.
2037,292-11,"An assessment of the absolute accuracy, with respect to 11 field measurement points, shows that the accuracy of MIcEL, with an average mean absolute error (MAE) of similar to 11%, is comparable with respect to the QUAC."
2038,293-1,"The societal benefits of understanding climate change through the identification of global carbon dioxide sources and sinks led to the recommendation for NASA's Active Sensing of Carbon Dioxide Emissions over Nights, Days, and Seasons space-based mission for global carbon dioxide measurements."
2039,293-2,"For more than 15 years, the NASA Langley Research Center has developed several carbon dioxide active remote sensors using the differential absorption lidar technique operating at 2-mu m wavelength."
2040,293-3,"Recently, an airborne double-pulsed integrated path differential absorption lidar was developed, tested, and validated for atmospheric carbon dioxide measurement."
2041,293-4,Results indicated 1.02% column carbon dioxide measurement uncertainty and 0.28% bias over the ocean.
2042,293-5,"Currently, this technology is progressing toward triple-pulse operation targeting both atmospheric carbon dioxide and water vapor-the dominant interfering molecule on carbon dioxide remote sensing."
2043,293-6,Measurements from the double-pulse lidar and the advancement of the triple-pulse lidar development are presented.
2044,293-7,"In addition, measurement simulations with a space-based IPDA lidar, incorporating new technologies, are also presented to assess feasibility of carbon dioxide measurements from space."
2045,294-1,Forest fire is one of the major natural hazards/disasters in Canada and many ecosystems across the world.
2046,294-2,"Here, our objective was to enhance the performance of an existing solely remote sensing-based forest fire danger forecasting system (FFDFS), and its implementation over the northern region of the Canadian province of Alberta."
2047,294-3,"The modified FFDFS was comprised of Moderate Resolution Imaging Spectroradiometer (MODIS)-derived daily surface temperature (Ts) and precipitable water (PW), and 8-day composite of normalized difference vegetation index (NDVI) and normalized difference water index (NDWI), where we assumed that cloud-contaminant pixels would reduce the risk of fire occurrences."
2048,294-4,"In addition, we generated ignition cause-specific static fire danger (SFD) maps derived using the historical human- and lightning-caused fires during the period 1961-2014."
2049,294-5,"Upon incorporating different combinations of the generated SFD maps with the modified FFDFS, we evaluated their performances against actual fire spots during the 2009-2011 fire seasons."
2050,294-6,"Our findings revealed that our proposed modifications were quite effective and the modified FFDFS captured almost the same amount of fires as the original FFDFS, i.e., about 77% of the detected fires on an average in the top three fire danger classes of extremely high, very high, and high categories, where about 50% of the study area fell under low and moderate danger classes."
2051,294-7,"Additionally, we observed that the combination of modified FFDFS and human-caused SFD map (road buffer) demonstrated the most effective results in fire detection, i.e., 82% of detected fires on an average in the top three fire danger classes, where about 46% of the study area fell under the moderate and low danger categories."
2052,294-8,We believe that our developments would be helpful to manage the forest fire in order to reduce its overall impact.
2053,295-1,"The Kabul River basin (KRB) of Afghanistan, a lifeline of around 10 million people, has multiplicity of governance, management, and development-related challenges leading to inequity, inadequacy, and unreliability of irrigation water distribution."
2054,295-2,"Prior to any uplifting intervention, there is a need to evaluate the performance of irrigation system on a long term basis to identify the existing bottlenecks."
2055,295-3,"Although there are several indicators available for the performance evaluation of the irrigation schemes, we used the coefficient of variation (CV) of actual evapotranspiration (ETa) in space (basin, sub-basin, and provincial level), relative evapotranspiration (RET), and temporal CV of RET, to assess the equity, adequacy, and reliability of water distribution, respectively, from 2003 to 2013."
2056,295-4,"The ETa was estimated through a surface energy balance system (SEBS) algorithm and the ETa estimates were validated using the advection aridity (AA) method with a R-2 value of 0.81 and 0.77 at Nawabad and Sultanpur stations, respectively."
2057,295-5,The global land data assimilation system (GLDAS) and moderate-resolution imaging spectroradiometer (MODIS) products were used as main inputs to the SEBS.
2058,295-6,Results show that the mean seasonal sub-based RET values during summer (May-September) (0.37 +/- 0.06) and winter (October-April) (0.40 +/- 0.08) are below the target values (RET 0.75) during 2003-2013.
2059,295-7,"The CV of the mean ETa, within sub-basins and provinces for the entire study period, has an equitable distribution of water from October-January (0.09 +/- 0.04), whereas the highest inequity (0.24 +/- 0.08) in water distribution is during early summer."
2060,295-8,The range of the CV of the mean ETa (0.04-0.06) on a monthly and seasonal basis shows the unreliability of water supplies in several provinces or sub-basins.
2061,295-9,The analysis of the temporal CV of mean RET highlights the unreliable water supplies across the entire basin.
2062,295-10,"The maximum ETa during the study period was estimated for the Shamal sub-basin (552 +/- 43 mm) while among the provinces, Kunar experienced the highest ETa (544 +/- 39 mm)."
2063,295-11,This study highlights the dire need for interventions to improve the irrigation performance in time and space.
2064,295-12,The proposed methodology can be used as a framework for monitoring and implementing water distribution plans in future.
2065,296-1,Vulnerability assessment is one of the prerequisites for risk analysis in disaster management.
2066,296-2,"Vulnerability to earthquakes, especially in urban areas, has increased over the years due to the presence of complex urban structures and rapid development."
2067,296-3,"Urban vulnerability is a result of human behavior which describes the extent of susceptibility or resilience of social, economic, and physical assets to natural disasters."
2068,296-4,"The main aim of this paper is to develop a new hybrid framework using Analytic Network Process (ANP) and Artificial Neural Network (ANN) models for constructing a composite social, economic, environmental, and physical vulnerability index."
2069,296-5,"This index was then applied to Tabriz City, which is a seismic-prone province in the northwestern part of Iran with recurring devastating earthquakes and consequent heavy casualties and damages."
2070,296-6,A Geographical Information Systems (GIS) analysis was used to identify and evaluate quantitative vulnerability indicators for generating an earthquake vulnerability map.
2071,296-7,The classified and standardized indicators were subsequently weighed and ranked using an ANP model to construct the training database.
2072,296-8,"Then, standardized maps coupled with the training site maps were presented as input to a Multilayer Perceptron (MLP) neural network for producing an Earthquake Vulnerability Map (EVM)."
2073,296-9,"Finally, an EVM was produced for Tabriz City and the level of vulnerability in various zones was obtained."
2074,296-10,"South and southeast regions of Tabriz City indicate low to moderate vulnerability, while some zones of the northeastern tract are under critical vulnerability conditions."
2075,296-11,"Furthermore, the impact of the vulnerability of Tabriz City on population during an earthquake was included in this analysis for risk estimation."
2076,296-12,A comparison of the result produced by EVM and the Population Vulnerability (PV) of Tabriz City corroborated the validity of the results obtained by ANP-ANN.
2077,296-13,"The findings of this paper are useful for decision-makers and government authorities to obtain a better knowledge of a city's vulnerability dimensions, and to adopt preparedness strategies in the future for Tabriz City."
2078,296-14,The developed hybrid framework of ANP and ANN Models can easily be replicated and applied to other urban regions around the world for sustainability and environmental management.
2079,297-1,The ability to accurately monitor and anticipate changes in consumptive water use associated with changing land use and land management is critical to developing sustainable water management strategies in water-limited climatic regions.
2080,297-2,"In this paper, we present an application of a remote sensing data fusion technique for developing high spatiotemporal resolution maps of evapotranspiration (ET) at scales that can be associated with changes in land use."
2081,297-3,"The fusion approach combines ET map timeseries developed using an multi-scale energy balance algorithm applied to thermal data from Earth observation platforms with high spatial but low temporal resolution (e.g., Landsat) and with moderate resolution but frequent temporal coverage (e.g., MODIS (Moderate Resolution Imaging Spectroradiometer))."
2082,297-4,The approach is applied over the Sacramento-San Joaquin Delta region in Californiaan area critical to both agricultural production and drinking water supply within the state that has recently experienced stresses on water resources due to a multi-year (2012-2017) extreme drought.
2083,297-5,ET datacubes with 30-m resolution and daily timesteps were constructed for the 2015-2016 water years and related to detailed maps of land use developed at the same spatial scale.
2084,297-6,"The ET retrievals are evaluated at flux sites over multiple land covers to establish a metric of accuracy in the annual water use estimates, yielding root-mean-square errors of 1.0, 0.8, and 0.3 mm day(-1) at daily, monthly, and yearly timesteps, respectively, for all sites combined."
2085,297-7,"Annual ET averaged over the Delta changed only 3 mm year(-1) between water years, from 822 to 819 mm year(-1), translating to an area-integrated total change in consumptive water use of seven thousand acre-feet (TAF)."
2086,297-8,"Changes were largest in areas with recorded land-use change between water yearsmost significantly, fallowing of crop land presumably in response to reductions in water availability and allocations due to the drought."
2087,297-9,"Moreover, the time evolution in water use associated with wetland restorationan effort aimed at reducing subsidence and carbon emissions within the inner Deltais assessed using a sample wetland chronosequence."
2088,297-10,Region-specific matrices of consumptive water use associated with land use changes may be an effective tool for policymakers and farmers to understand how land use conversion could impact consumptive use and demand.
2089,298-1,"Depending on the band position on the electromagnetic spectrum, optical and electronic characteristics, sensors collect the reflected energy by the Earth's surface and the atmosphere."
2090,298-2,"Currently, the availability of the new generation of medium resolution, such as the Multi-Spectral Instrument (MSI) on board the Sentinel-2 satellite, offers new opportunities for long-term high-temporal frequency for Earth's surfaces observation and monitoring."
2091,298-3,"This paper focuses on the analysis and the comparison of the visible, the near-infrared (VNIR), and the shortwave infrared (SWIR) spectral bands of the MSI for soil salinity discrimination in an arid landscape."
2092,298-4,"To achieve these, a field campaign was organized, and 160 soil samples were collected with various degrees of soil salinity, including non-saline soil samples."
2093,298-5,The bidirectional reflectance factor was measured above each soil sample in a goniometric laboratory using an ASD (Analytical Spectral Devices) spectroradiometer.
2094,298-6,"In the laboratory work, pHs, electrical conductivity (EC-(Lab)), and the major soluble cations (Na+, K+, Ca2++, and Mg2+) and anions (CO32-, HCO3-, Cl-, and SO42-) were measured using extraction from a saturated soil paste, and the sodium adsorption ratio (SAR) was calculated using a standard procedure."
2095,298-7,"These parameters, in addition to the field observations, were used to interpret and investigate the spectroradiometric measurements and their relevant transformations using the continuum removed reflectance spectrum (CRRS) and the first derivative (FD)."
2096,298-8,"Moreover, the acquired spectra over all the soil samples were resampled and convolved in the solar-reflective spectral bands using the Canadian Modified Herman transfer radiative code (CAM5S) and the relative spectral response profiles characterizing the Sentinel-MSI band filters."
2097,298-9,The statistical analyses conducted were based on the second-order polynomial regression (p < 0.05) between the measured EC-(Lab) and the reflectances in the MSI convolved spectral bands.
2098,298-10,The results obtained indicate the limitation of VNIR bands and the potential of SWIR domain for soil salinity classes' discrimination.
2099,298-11,"The CRRS and the FD analyses highlighted a serious spectral-signal confusion between the salt and the soil optical properties (i.e., color and brightness) in the VNIR bands."
2100,298-12,"Likewise, the results stressed the independence of the SWIR domain vis-a-vis these soil artifacts and its capability to differentiate significantly among several soil salinity classes."
2101,298-13,"Moreover, the statistical fit between each MSI individual spectral band and EC-(Lab) corroborates this trend, which revealed that only the SWIR bands were correlated significantly (R-2 of 50% and 64%, for SWIR-1 and SWIR-2, respectively), while the R-2 between the VNIR bands and EC-(Lab) remains less than 9%."
2102,298-14,"According to the convergence of these four independent analysis methods, it is concluded that the Sentinel-MSI SWIR bands are excellent candidates for an integration in soil salinity modeling and monitoring at local, regional, and global scales."
2103,299-1,"Modelling ecological niches across vast distribution ranges in remote, high mountain regions like the Himalayas faces several data limitations, in particular nonavailability of species occurrence data and fine-scale environmental information of sufficiently high quality."
2104,299-2,"Remotely sensed data provide key advantages such as frequent, complete, and long-term observations of land surface parameters with full spatial coverage."
2105,299-3,The objective of this study is to evaluate modelled climate data as well as remotely sensed data for modelling the ecological niche of Betula utilis in the subalpine and alpine belts of the Himalayan region covering the entire Himalayan arc.
2106,299-4,"Using generalized linear models (GLM), we aim at testing factors controlling the species distribution under current climate conditions."
2107,299-5,"We evaluate the additional predictive capacity of remotely sensed variables, namely remotely sensed topography and vegetation phenology data (phenological traits), as well as the capability to substitute bioclimatic variables from downscaled numerical models by remotely sensed annual land surface temperature parameters."
2108,299-6,"The best performing model utilized bioclimatic variables, topography, and phenological traits, and explained over 69% of variance, while models exclusively based on remotely sensed data reached 65% of explained variance."
2109,299-7,"In summary, models based on bioclimatic variables and topography combined with phenological traits led to a refined prediction of the current niche of B. utilis, whereas models using solely climate data consistently resulted in overpredictions."
2110,299-8,Our results suggest that remotely sensed phenological traits can be applied beneficially as supplements to improve model accuracy and to refine the prediction of the species niche.
2111,299-9,"We conclude that the combination of remotely sensed land surface temperature parameters is promising, in particular in regions where sufficient fine-scale climate data are not available."
2112,3-1,"The Mediterranean Sea exhibits a strong basin and regional scale phytoplankton variability correlated to its semi-enclosed nature, complex orography and the variety of physical and chemical processes that regulate its productivity."
2113,3-2,"Herein, using 17 years of ocean-color composites, we investigate differences in the regional patterns of interannual variability in satellite-derived chlorophyll (Chl), a proxy for phytoplankton biomass."
2114,3-3,"A neural network classification, based on the Self-Organizing Maps (SOM) analysis in the time domain, is used to reveal regions of similar temporal variability of Chl in the Mediterranean Sea."
2115,3-4,Characteristic temporal patterns extracted by the SOM analysis show different scales of variation that can be related to already identified oceanographic features and biogeochemical variability in the Mediterranean Sea.
2116,3-5,"Clear differences are noticed between regions located in the Western basin and Adriatic Sea, where rivers, winter mixing and winds are known to drive variations in primary production at regional scale and regions located in the Eastern basin, represented by a large and rather homogeneous region."
2117,3-6,"Using the SOM-defined characteristic temporal patterns of Chl, we analyzed the regional influence of the North Atlantic Oscillation (NAO) and El Nino Southern Oscillation (ENSO) in the long-term (> 1 year) Chl variability."
2118,3-7,Our results indicate that NAO has more influence in the Chl variations occurring in regions located in the Western basin whereas ENSO exhibits higher impact on the central Mediterranean and Eastern basin during its positive phase.
2119,3-8,Both NAO and ENSO show non-stationary coherence with Mediterranean Chl.
2120,3-9,"The analysis also reveals a sharp regime shift occurring in 2004-2007, when NAO changed from positive to negative values."
2121,3-10,This shift particularly affected the winter phytoplankton biomass and it is indicative of climate driven ecosystem-level changes in the Mediterranean Sea.
2122,3-11,Our results stablish a regional connection between interannual phytoplankton variability exhibited in different regions of the Mediterranean Sea and climate variations.
2123,30-1,Semantic segmentation of LiDAR and high-resolution aerial imagery is one of the most challenging topics in the remote sensing domain.
2124,30-2,Deep convolutional neural network (CNN) and its derivatives have recently shown the abilities in pixel-wise prediction of remote sensing data.
2125,30-3,Many existing deep learning methods fuse LiDAR and high-resolution aerial imagery towards an inter-modal mode and thus overlook the intra-modal statistical characteristics.
2126,30-4,"Additionally, the patch-based CNNs could generate the salt-and-pepper artifacts as characterized by isolated and spurious pixels on the object boundaries and patch edges leading to unsatisfied labelling results."
2127,30-5,This paper presents a semantic segmentation scheme that combines multi-filter CNN and multi-resolution segmentation (MRS).
2128,30-6,"The multi-filter CNN aggregates LiDAR data and high-resolution optical imagery by multi modal data fusion for semantic labelling, and the MRS is further used to delineate object boundaries for reducing the salt-and-pepper artifacts."
2129,30-7,The proposed method is validated against two datasets: the ISPRS 2D semantic labelling contest of Potsdam and an area of Guangzhou in China labelled based on existing geodatabases.
2130,30-8,"Various designs of data fusion strategy, CNN architecture and MRS scale are analyzed and discussed."
2131,30-9,"Compared with other classification methods, our method improves the overall accuracies."
2132,30-10,Experiment results show that our combined method is an efficient solution for the semantic segmentation of LiDAR and high-resolution imagery.
2133,300-1,"The nearshore coastal ocean is one of the most dynamic and biologically productive regions on our planet, supporting a wide range of ecosystem services."
2134,300-2,"It is also one of the most vulnerable regions, increasingly exposed to anthropogenic pressure."
2135,300-3,"In the context of climate change, monitoring changes in nearshore coastal waters requires systematic and sustained observations of key essential climate variables (ECV), one of which is sea surface temperature (SST)."
2136,300-4,"As temperature influences physical, chemical and biological processes within coastal systems, accurate monitoring is crucial for detecting change."
2137,300-5,SST is an ECV that can be measured systematically from satellites.
2138,300-6,"Yet, owing to a lack of adequate in situ data, the accuracy and precision of satellite SST at the coastline are not well known."
2139,300-7,"In a prior study, we attempted to address this by taking advantage of in situ SST measurements collected by a group of surfers."
2140,300-8,"Here, we make use of a three year time-series (2014-2017) of in situ water temperature measurements collected using a temperature logger (recording every 30 min) deployed within a kelp forest (approximate to 3 m below chart datum) at a subtidal rocky reef site near Plymouth, UK."
2141,300-9,"We compared the temperature measurements with three other independent in situ SST datasets in the region, from two autonomous buoys located approximate to 7 km and approximate to 33 km from the coastline, and from a group of surfers at two beaches near the kelp site."
2142,300-10,"The three datasets showed good agreement, with discrepancies consistent with the spatial separation of the sites."
2143,300-11,"The in situ SST measurements collected from the kelp site and the two autonomous buoys were matched with operational Advanced Very High Resolution Radiometer (AVHRR) EO SST passes, all within 1 h of the in situ data."
2144,300-12,"By extracting data from the closest satellite pixel to the three sites, we observed a significant reduction in the performance of AVHRR at retrieving SST at the coastline, with root mean square differences at the kelp site over twice that observed at the two offshore buoys."
2145,300-13,Comparing the in situ water temperature data with pixels surrounding the kelp site revealed the performance of the satellite data improves when moving two to three pixels offshore and that this improvement was better when using an SST algorithm that treats each pixel independently in the retrieval process.
2146,300-14,"At the three sites, we related differences between satellite and in situ SST data with a suite of atmospheric variables, collected from a nearby atmospheric observatory, and a high temporal resolution land surface temperature (LST) dataset."
2147,300-15,"We found that differences between satellite and in situ SST at the coastline (kelp site) were well correlated with LST and solar zenith angle; implying contamination of the pixel by land is the principal cause of these larger differences at the coastline, as opposed to issues with atmospheric correction."
2148,300-16,"This contamination could be either from land directly within the pixel, potentially impacted by errors in geo-location, or possibly through thermal adjacency effects."
2149,300-17,"Our results demonstrate the value of using benthic temperature loggers for evaluating satellite SST data in coastal regions, and highlight issues with retrievals at the coastline that may inform future improvements in operational products."
2150,301-1,"The satellite of the TerraSAR-X mission, called TSX, was launched on 15 June 2007 and its identically constructed twin satellite TDX, which is required by the mission TanDEM-X, launched on 21 June 2010."
2151,301-2,Together they supply high-quality radar data in order to serve two mission goals: Scientific observation of Earth and the provisioning of remote sensing data for the commercial market (TerraSAR-X mission) and the generation of a global digital elevation model (DEM) of Earth's surface (TanDEM-X mission).
2152,301-3,"On the occasion of the 10th anniversary of the mission, the focus will be on the development of the TerraSAR-X system during this period, including the extension of the ground segment, the evolution of the product portfolio, dedicated mission campaigns, radar experiments, refinement of the satellite operations and orbit control, and the results of the performance monitoring."
2153,301-4,"Despite numerous interventions in the overall system, we managed to incorporate new scientific and commercial requirements and to improve and enhance the overall system in order to fulfill the increasing demand for Earth observation data without noticeable interruptions to ongoing operations."
2154,302-1,Forest biophysical variables derived from remote sensing observations are vital for climate research.
2155,302-2,The combination of structurally and radiometrically accurate 3D virtual forests with radiative transfer (RT) models creates a powerful tool to facilitate the calibration and validation of remote sensing data and derived biophysical products by helping us understand the assumptions made in data processing algorithms.
2156,302-3,We present a workflow that uses highly detailed 3D terrestrial laser scanning (TLS) data to generate virtual forests for RT model simulations.
2157,302-4,Our approach to forest stand reconstruction from a co-registered point cloud is unique as it models each tree individually.
2158,302-5,Our approach follows three steps: (1) tree segmentation; (2) tree structure modelling and (3) leaf addition.
2159,302-6,"To demonstrate this approach, we present the measurement and construction of a one hectare model of the deciduous forest in Wytham Woods (Oxford, UK)."
2160,302-7,The model contains 559 individual trees.
2161,302-8,We matched the TLS data with traditional census data to determine the species of each individual tree and allocate species-specific radiometric properties.
2162,302-9,"Our modelling framework is generic, highly transferable and adjustable to data collected with other TLS instruments and different ecosystems."
2163,302-10,The Wytham Woods virtual forest is made publicly available through an online repository.
2164,303-1,Geospatial object detection from high spatial resolution (HSR) remote sensing imagery is a heated and challenging problem in the field of automatic image interpretation.
2165,303-2,"Despite convolutional neural networks (CNNs) having facilitated the development in this domain, the computation efficiency under real-time application and the accurate positioning on relatively small objects in HSR images are two noticeable obstacles which have largely restricted the performance of detection methods."
2166,303-3,"To tackle the above issues, we first introduce semantic segmentation-aware CNN features to activate the detection feature maps from the lowest level layer."
2167,303-4,"In conjunction with this segmentation branch, another module which consists of several global activation blocks is proposed to enrich the semantic information of feature maps from higher level layers."
2168,303-5,"Then, these two parts are integrated and deployed into the original single shot detection framework."
2169,303-6,"Finally, we use the modified multi-scale feature maps with enriched semantics and multi-task training strategy to achieve end-to-end detection with high efficiency."
2170,303-7,Extensive experiments and comprehensive evaluations on a publicly available 10-class object detection dataset have demonstrated the superiority of the presented method.
2171,304-1,Understanding the influence of mesoscale and submesoscale features on the structure of phytoplankton is a key aspect in the assessment of their influence on marine biogeochemical cycling and cross-shore exchanges of plankton in Eastern Boundary Current Systems (EBCS).
2172,304-2,"In this study, the spatio-temporal evolution of phytoplankton size classes (PSC) in surface waters associated with mesoscale eddies in the EBCS off central-southern Chile was analyzed."
2173,304-3,"Chlorophyll-a (Chl-a) size-fractionated filtration (SFF) data from in situ samplings in coastal and coastal transition waters were used to tune a three-component (micro-, nano-, and pico-phytoplankton) model, which was then applied to total Chl-a satellite data (ESA OC-CCI product) in order to retrieve the Chl-a concentration of each PSC."
2174,304-4,"A sea surface, height-based eddy-tracking algorithm was used to identify and track one cyclonic (sC) and three anticyclonic (ssAC1, ssAC2, sAC) mesoscale eddies between January 2014 and October 2015."
2175,304-5,"Satellite estimates of PSC and in situ SFF Chl-a data were highly correlated (0.64 < r < 0.87), although uncertainty values for the microplankton fraction were moderate to high (50 to 100% depending on the metric used)."
2176,304-6,"The largest changes in size structure took place during the early life of eddies (similar to 2 months), and no major differences in PSC between eddy center and periphery were found."
2177,304-7,"The contribution of the microplankton fraction was similar to 50% (similar to 30%) in sC and ssAC1 (ssAC2 and sAC) eddies when they were located close to the coast, while nanoplankton was dominant (similar to 60-70%) and picoplankton almost constant (<20%) throughout the lifetime of eddies."
2178,304-8,"These results suggest that the three-component model, which has been mostly applied in oceanic waters, is also applicable to highly productive coastal upwelling systems."
2179,304-9,"Additionally, the PSC changes within mesoscale eddies obtained by this satellite approach are in agreement with results on phytoplankton size distribution in mesoscale and submesoscale features in this region, and are most likely triggered by variations in nutrient concentrations and/or ratios during the eddies' lifetimes."
2180,305-1,"The Gravity Recovery and Climate Experiment (GRACE) satellite mission, which was in operation from March 2002 to June 2017, was the first remote sensing mission to provide temporal variations of Terrestrial Water Storage (TWS), which is the sum of the water masses that were contained in the soil column (i.e., snow, surface water, soil moisture, and groundwater), at a spatial resolution of a few hundred kilometers."
2181,305-2,"As in situ level measurements are generally not sufficiently available for monitoring groundwater changes at the regional-scale, this unique dataset, combined with external information, is widely used to quantify the interannual variations of groundwater storage in the world's major aquifers."
2182,305-3,"GRACE-based groundwater changes revealed significant aquifer depletion over large regions, such as the Middle East, the northwest India aquifer, the North China Plain aquifer, the Murray-Darling Basin in Australia, the High Plains, and the California Central Valley aquifers in the United States of America (USA), but were also used to estimate groundwater-related parameters such as the specific yield, which relates groundwater level to storage, or to define the indices of groundwater depletion and stress."
2183,305-4,"In this review, the approaches used for estimating groundwater storage variations are presented along with the main applications of GRACE data for groundwater monitoring."
2184,305-5,Issues that were related to the use of GRACE-based TWS are also addressed.
2185,306-1,Monitoring Land Surface Temperature (LST) from satellite remote sensing requires an accurate correction of the atmospheric effects.
2186,306-2,"Although thermal remote sensing techniques have advanced significantly over the past few decades, to date, single-band pixel-by-pixel atmospheric correction of full thermal images is unsolved."
2187,306-3,"In this work, we introduce a new Single-Band Atmospheric Correction (SBAC) tool that provides pixel-by-pixel atmospheric correction parameters regardless of the pixel size."
2188,306-4,"The SBAC tool uses National Centers of Environmental Prediction (NCEP) profiles as inputs and, as a novelty, it also accounts for pixel elevation through a Digital Elevation Model (DEM)."
2189,306-5,Application of SBAC to 19 Landsat 7-ETM+ scenes shows the potential of the proposed pixel-by-pixel atmospheric correction to capture terrain orography or atmospheric variability within the scene.
2190,306-6,LST estimation yields negligible bias and an RMSE of +/- 1.6 K for the full dataset.
2191,306-7,The Landsat Atmospheric Correction Tool (ACT) is also considered for comparison.
2192,306-8,"SBAC-ACT LST deviations are analyzed in terms of distance to the image center, surface elevation, and spatial distribution of the atmospheric water content."
2193,306-9,Differences within 3 K are observed.
2194,306-10,These results give us the first insight of the potential of SBAC for the operational pixel-by-pixel atmospheric correction of full thermal images.
2195,306-11,The SBAC tool is expected to help users of satellite single-channel thermal sensors to improve their LST estimates due to its simplicity and robustness.
2196,307-1,Synthetic aperture radar automatic target recognition (SAR-ATR) has made great progress in recent years.
2197,307-2,"Most of the established recognition methods are supervised, which have strong dependence on image labels."
2198,307-3,"However, obtaining the labels of radar images is expensive and time-consuming."
2199,307-4,"In this paper, we present a semi-supervised learning method that is based on the standard deep convolutional generative adversarial networks (DCGANs)."
2200,307-5,We double the discriminator that is used in DCGANs and utilize the two discriminators for joint training.
2201,307-6,"In this process, we introduce a noisy data learning theory to reduce the negative impact of the incorrectly labeled samples on the performance of the networks."
2202,307-7,We replace the last layer of the classic discriminators with the standard softmax function to output a vector of class probabilities so that we can recognize multiple objects.
2203,307-8,We subsequently modify the loss function in order to adapt to the revised network structure.
2204,307-9,"In our model, the two discriminators share the same generator, and we take the average value of them when computing the loss function of the generator, which can improve the training stability of DCGANs to some extent."
2205,307-10,We also utilize images of higher quality from the generated images for training in order to improve the performance of the networks.
2206,307-11,"Our method has achieved state-of-the-art results on the Moving and Stationary Target Acquisition and Recognition (MSTAR) dataset, and we have proved that using the generated images to train the networks can improve the recognition accuracy with a small number of labeled samples."
2207,308-1,"In recent decades, road extraction from very high-resolution (VHR) remote sensing images has become popular and has attracted extensive research efforts."
2208,308-2,"However, the very high spatial resolution, complex urban structure, and contextual background effect of road images complicate the process of road extraction."
2209,308-3,"For example, shadows, vehicles, or other objects may occlude a road located in a developed urban area."
2210,308-4,"To address the problem of occlusion, this study proposes a semiautomatic approach for road extraction from VHR remote sensing images."
2211,308-5,"First, guided image filtering is employed to reduce the negative effects of nonroad pixels while preserving edge smoothness."
2212,308-6,"Then, an edge-constraint-based weighted fusion model is adopted to trace and refine the road centerline."
2213,308-7,"An edge-constraint fast marching method, which sequentially links discrete seed points, is presented to maintain road-point connectivity."
2214,308-8,Six experiments with eight VHR remote sensing images (spatial resolution of 0.3 m/pixel to 2 m/pixel) are conducted to evaluate the efficiency and robustness of the proposed approach.
2215,308-9,"Compared with state-of-the-art methods, the proposed approach presents superior extraction quality, time consumption, and seed-point requirements."
2216,309-1,A Bayesian classifier mapped the Burned Area (BA) in the Northeastern Siberian boreal forest (70 degrees N 120 degrees E-60 degrees N 170 degrees E) from 1982 to 2015.
2217,309-2,The algorithm selected the 0.05 degrees (similar to 5 km) Long-Term Data Record (LTDR) version 3 and 4 data sets to generate 10-day BA composites.
2218,309-3,"Landsat-TM scenes of the entire study site in 2002, 2010, and 2011 assessed the spatial accuracy of this LTDR-BA product, in comparison to Moderate-Resolution Imaging Spectroradiometer (MODIS) MCD45A1 and MCD64A1 BA products."
2219,309-4,"The LTDR-BA algorithm proves a reliable source to quantify BA in this part of Siberia, where comprehensive BA remote sensing products since the 1980s are lacking."
2220,309-5,"Once grouped by year and decade, this study explored the trends in fire activity."
2221,309-6,"The LTDR-BA estimates contained a high interannual variability with a maximum of 2.42 million ha in 2002, an average of 0.78 million ha/year, and a standard deviation of 0.61 million ha."
2222,309-7,"Going from 6.36 in the 1980s to 10.21 million ha BA in the 2010s, there was a positive linear BA trend of approximately 1.28 million ha/decade during these last four decades in the Northeastern Siberian boreal forest."
2223,31-1,"Accurate assessments of forest resources rely on ground truth data that are collected via in-situ measurements, which are fundamental for all other statistical- and/or remote-sensing-based deductions on quantified forest attributes."
2224,31-2,"The major bottleneck of the current in-situ observation system is that the data collection is time consuming, and, thus, limited in extent, which potentially biases any further inferences made."
2225,31-3,"Consequently, conventional field-data-collection approaches can hardly keep pace with the coverage, scale and frequency required for contemporary and future forest inventories."
2226,31-4,"In-situ measurements from mobile platforms seem to be a promising technique to solve this problem and are estimated at least 10 times faster than static techniques (e.g., terrestrial laser scanning, TLS) at the plot level."
2227,31-5,"However, the mobile platforms are still at the very early stages of development, and it is unclear which three-dimensional (3D) forest measurements the mobile systems can provide and at what accuracy."
2228,31-6,This study presents a quantitative evaluation of the performance of mobile platforms in a variety of forest conditions and through a comparison with state-of-the-art static in-situ observations.
2229,31-7,"Two mobile platforms were used to collect field data, where the same laser-scanning system was both mounted on top of a vehicle and wore by an operator."
2230,31-8,The static in-situ observation from TLS is used as a baseline for the evaluation.
2231,31-9,All point clouds involved were processed through the same processing chain and compared to conventional manual measurement.
2232,31-10,"The evaluation results indicate that the mobile platforms can assess homogeneous forests as well as static observations, but they cannot yet assess heterogeneous forest as required by practical applications."
2233,31-11,The major challenge is twofold: mobile-data coverage and accuracy.
2234,31-12,"Future research should focus on the robust registration techniques between strips, especially in complex forest conditions, since errors of data registration results in significant impacts on tree attributes estimation accuracy."
2235,31-13,"In cases that the spatial inconstancy cannot be eliminated, attributes estimation in single strips, i.e., the multi single-scan approach, is an alternative."
2236,31-14,"Meanwhile, operator training deserves attention since the data quality from mobile platforms is partly determined by the operators' selection of trajectory in the field."
2237,310-1,"In forestry studies, remote sensing has been widely used to monitor deforestation and estimate biomass, and it has contributed to forest carbon stock management."
2238,310-2,A major problem when estimating biomass from optical and SAR remote sensing images is the saturation effect.
2239,310-3,"As a solution, PolInSAR offers a high coverage height map that can be transformed into a biomass map."
2240,310-4,Temporal decorrelation may affect the accuracy of PolInSAR and may also have an effect on the accuracy of the biomass estimates.
2241,310-5,"In this study, we compared three different height estimation models: the Random-Volume-over-Ground (RVoG), Random-Motion-over-Ground (RMoG), and Random-Motion-over-Ground-Legendre (RMoG) models."
2242,310-6,"The RVoG model does not take into account the temporal decorrelation, while the other two compensate for temporal decorrelation but differ in structure function."
2243,310-7,The comparison was done on 214 field plots of the 10 m radius of the BioSAR2010 campaign.
2244,310-8,"Different models relating PolInSAR height and biomass were developed by using polynomial, exponential, power series, and piece-wise linear regression."
2245,310-9,Different strategies for training and test subset selection were followed to obtain the best possible regression models.
2246,310-10,The study showed that the RMoGmodel provided the most accurate biomass predictions.
2247,310-11,The relation between RMoGs height and biomass is well expressed by the exponential model with an average RMSE equal to 48 ton value equal to 0.62.
2248,310-12,"The relative errors for estimated biomass were equal to 46% for the RVoG model, to 37% for the RMoG, and to 30% for the RMoG model."
2249,310-13,We concluded that taking the temporal decorrelation into account for estimating tree height has a significant effect on providing accurate biomass estimates.
2250,311-1,This work communicates the discovery of a sandy buried 10.5 km diameter near-circular structure in the eastern part of the Great Sahara in North Africa.
2251,311-2,"Rimaal, meaning sand in Arabic, is given as the name for this structure since it is largely concealed beneath the Sahara Aeolian sand."
2252,311-3,"Remote sensing image fusion and transformation of multispectral data (from Landsat-8) and synthetic aperture radar (from Sentinel-1 and ALOS PALSAR), of dual wavelengths (C and L-bands) and multi-polarization (HV, VV, HH, and HV), were adopted in this work."
2253,311-4,The optical and microwave hybrid imagery enabled the combining of surface spectral properties and subsurface roughness information for better understanding of the Rimaal structure.
2254,311-5,"The long wavelength of the radar, in particular, enabled the penetration of desert sands and the revealing of the proposed structure."
2255,311-6,"The structure exhibits a clear outer rim with traces of concentric faults, an annular flat basin and an inner ring surrounding remnants of a highly eroded central peak."
2256,311-7,"Radar imagery clearly shows the interior wall of the structure is incised with radial pattern gullies that originate at or near the crater periphery, implying a much steeper rim wall in the past."
2257,311-8,"In addition, data reveals a circumferential of a paleoriver course that flows along a curved path parallel to the crater's western margin indicating the plausible presence of a concentric ring graben related to the inferred structure."
2258,311-9,The defined crater boundary is coincident with a shallow semi-circular-like basin in the SRTM elevation data.
2259,311-10,The structure portrays considerable modifications by extensive long-term Aeolian and fluvial erosion.
2260,311-11,Residing in the Cretaceous Nubian Sandstone formation suggests an old age of 65 Ma for the structure.
2261,311-12,"If proven to be of an impact origin, the Rimaal structure could help in understanding the early evolution of the landscape of the Eastern Sahara and holds promise for hosting economically valuable ore deposits and hydrocarbon resources in the region."
2262,312-1,A methodology for the measurement of height in water reservoirs is developed.
2263,312-2,It is based on Sentinel 2 imagery and aerial LiDAR data.
2264,312-3,"The methodology is automatized using Matlab software and focused on image processing techniques (equalization, binarization, and edge detection) combined with LiDAR data processing (near neighbour search and height averaging)."
2265,312-4,It is applied in a region of interest selected by the user characterized by a water-land interface.
2266,312-5,Results are validated in the As Conchas water reservoir (Spain) using an in situ sensing system provided by the Hydrographic Mino-Sil Confederation.
2267,312-6,The duration of the experiment was one year.
2268,312-7,"The Sentinel 2 bands B2, B3, B4, and B8 were tested during this study."
2269,312-8,The best results for water height evaluation were obtained for band B8 (842 nm) with an error of 0.20 m and a standard deviation of 0.17 m.
2270,312-9,The time resolution of the technique depends on the Sentinel 2 revisit time.
2271,312-10,The time resolution and height accuracy could be improved using complementary satellite systems.
2272,313-1,"In this paper, we present the results of eight years of continuous monitoring with a ground-based, interferometric, real-aperture radar of two unstable mountain blocks at Tafjord on the western coast of Norway."
2273,313-2,"A real-time, interferometric, ground-based radar has the capability to provide high accuracy range measurements by using the phase of the transmitted signal, thus achieving sub-millimeter accuracy when a sufficient signal-to-noise level is present."
2274,313-3,The main challenge with long term monitoring is the variations in radio refractivity caused by changes in the atmosphere.
2275,313-4,The range variations caused by refractive changes in the atmosphere are corrected using meteorological data.
2276,313-5,We use triangular corner reflectors as references to improve the signal-to-clutter ratio and improve the accuracy of the measurements.
2277,313-6,"We have also shown that by using differential interferometry, a significant part of the variation caused by radio refractivity variations is removed."
2278,313-7,The overall reduction in path length variation when using differential interferometry varies from 27 to 164 times depending on the radar-to-reflector path length.
2279,313-8,"The measurements reveal cyclic seasonal variations, which are coherent with air temperature."
2280,313-9,"The results show that radar measurements are as accurate as data from in situ instruments like extensometers and crack meters, making it possible to monitor inaccessible areas."
2281,313-10,The total measured displacement is between 1.2 mm and 4.7 mm for the two monitored mountain blocks.
2282,314-1,"As the worst natural disaster on record in Dominica and Puerto Rico, Hurricane Maria in September 2017 had a large impact on the vegetation of these islands."
2283,314-2,"In this paper, multitemporal Landsat 8 OLI and Sentinel-2 data are used to investigate vegetation damage on Dominica and Puerto Rico by Hurricane Maria, and related influencing factors are analyzed."
2284,314-3,"Moreover, the changes in the normalized difference vegetation index (NDVI) in the year 2017 are compared to reference years (2015 and 2016)."
2285,314-4,"The results show that (1) there is a sudden drop in NDVI values after Hurricane Maria's landfall (decreased about 0.2) which returns to near normal vegetation after 1.5 months; (2) different land cover types have different sensitivities to Hurricane Maria, whereby forest is the most sensitive type, then followed by wetland, built-up, and natural grassland; and (3) for Puerto Rico, the vegetation damage is highly correlated with distance from the storm center and elevation."
2286,314-5,"For Dominica, where the whole island is within Hurricane Maria's radius of maximum wind, the vegetation damage has no obvious relationship to elevation or distance."
2287,314-6,"The study provides insight into the sensitivity and recovery of vegetation after a major land-falling hurricane, and may lead to improved vegetation protection strategies."
2288,315-1,Previous studies have shown that thermal infrared radiation (TIR) changes with stress for loaded rocks.
2289,315-2,TIR changes were mainly attributed to temperature change without considering the change in surface emissivity.
2290,315-3,And it remains unclear whether there was a change in emissivity during the rock loading process.
2291,315-4,"Therefore, based on the spectral radiance observations in this paper, an experimental study involving the emissivity variation in the 8.0-13.0 m range for elastic loaded quartz sandstone under outdoor conditions was conducted."
2292,315-5,The experiments yield the following results.
2293,315-6,"First, a variation in the stress condition led to the emissivity change in addition to the temperature change."
2294,315-7,The spectral radiance change was the combined result of the temperature changes and emissivity changes.
2295,315-8,"Second, the emissivity changes linearly with the stress change, and the amplitude is relatively large in the 8.0-10.0 m range."
2296,315-9,The waveband features of emissivity variation are the main factor leading to the waveband features of stress-induced radiance change.
2297,315-10,"Third, the explanations for the changes in temperature and emissivity during loading process are analyzed."
2298,315-11,And the significance and difficulty for further satellite remote sensing purpose is discussed.
2299,315-12,The experimental results provide an experimental foundation for crustal stress field monitoring.
2300,316-1,Haze removal is a pre-processing step that operates on at-sensor radiance data prior to the physically based image correction step to enhance hazy imagery visually.
2301,316-2,"Most current haze removal methods focus on point-to-point operations and utilize information in the spectral domain, without taking consideration of the multi-scale spatial information of haze."
2302,316-3,"In this paper, we propose a multi-scale residual convolutional neural network (MRCNN) for haze removal of remote sensing images."
2303,316-4,MRCNN utilizes 3D convolutional kernels to extract spatial-spectral correlation information and abstract features from surrounding neighborhoods for haze transmission estimation.
2304,316-5,It takes advantage of dilated convolution to aggregate multi-scale contextual information for the purpose of improving its prediction accuracy.
2305,316-6,"Meanwhile, residual learning is utilized to avoid the loss of weak information while deepening the network."
2306,316-7,"Our experiments indicate that MRCNN performs accurately, achieving an extremely low validation error and testing error."
2307,316-8,"The haze removal results of several scenes of Landsat 8 Operational Land Imager (OLI) data show that the visibility of the dehazed images is significantly improved, and the color of recovered surface is consistent with the actual scene."
2308,316-9,Quantitative analysis proves that the dehazed results of MRCNN are superior to the traditional methods and other networks.
2309,316-10,"Additionally, a comparison to haze-free data illustrates the spectral consistency after haze removal and reveals the changes in the vegetation index."
2310,317-1,"Remote sensing tools (RS) can contribute to a better understanding of the diversity of natural and semi-naturals habitats, their spatial distribution, and their conservation status."
2311,317-2,RS can also provide a generic set of derived indicators to support local to regional habitat monitoring.
2312,317-3,Here we propose a set of synthetic continuous textural indices computed from high spatial resolution airborne images for the characterization of vegetation structure in very heterogeneous landscape mosaics.
2313,317-4,These indices are based on Fourier-based textural ordination (FOTO) of very-high-resolution images.
2314,317-5,"We investigate the relationship between textural indices and a set of common landscape metrics derived from vegetation maps, identifying four strata of interest: bare soil, herbs, low ligneous, and high ligneous."
2315,317-6,"We identify two continuous textural indices, the first one being related to vegetation strata fragmentation and the second being related to the dominance of high ligneous."
2316,317-7,The combination of these two textural indices with the Normalized Difference Vegetation Index (NDVI) provides a synoptic and accurate overview of the spatial organization of the different vegetation strata.
2317,317-8,The methodological approach presented herein has a generic value in response to national conservation targets in the context of mapping relevant habitat indicators.
2318,318-1,"Significant gaps exist in our knowledge of the impact of leaf aging on canopy signal variability, which limits our understanding of vegetation status based on remotely sensed data."
2319,318-2,"To understand the effects of leaf aging at the leaf and canopy scales, a combination of field, remote-sensing and physical modeling techniques was adopted to assess the canopy spectral signals of evergreen Cunninghamia forests."
2320,318-3,We observed an approximately 10% increase in Near-Infrared (NIR) reflectance for new leaves and a 35% increase in NIR transmittance for mature leaves from May to October.
2321,318-4,"When variations in leaf optical properties (LOPs) of only mature leaves, or both new and mature leaves were considered, the Geometric Optical and Radiative Transfer (GORT) model-simulated canopy reflectance trajectory was more consistent with Landsat observations (R-2 increased from 0.37 to 0.82 similar to 0.89 for NIR reflectance, and from 0.35 to 0.67 similar to 0.88 for EVI2, with a small RMSE (0.01 to 0.02))."
2322,318-5,"This study highlights the importance of leaf age on leaf spectral signatures, and provides evidence of age-dependent LOPs that have important impacts on canopy reflectance in the NIR band and EVI2, which are used to monitor canopy dynamics and productivity, with important implications for RS and forest ecosystem ecology."
2323,319-1,"The unicellular cyanobacterium Prochlorococcus is the most dominant resident of the subtropical gyres, which are considered to be the largest biomes on earth."
2324,319-2,"In this study, the spatial and temporal variability in the global distribution of Prochlorococcus was estimated in the Atlantic Ocean using an empirical model based on data from 13 Atlantic Meridional Transect cruises."
2325,319-3,"Our model uses satellite-derived sea surface temperature (SST), remote-sensing reflectance at 443 and 488 nm, and the water temperature at a depth of 200 m from Argo data."
2326,319-4,"The model divides the population of Prochlorococcus into two groups: ProI, which dominates under high-light conditions associated with the surface, and ProII, which favors low light found near the deep chlorophyll maximum."
2327,319-5,ProI and ProII are then summed to provide vertical profiles of the concentration of Prochlorococcus cells.
2328,319-6,"This model predicts that Prochlorococcus cells contribute 32 Mt of carbon biomass (7.4 x 10(26) cells) to the Atlantic Ocean, concentrated mainly within the subtropical gyres (35%) and areas near the Equatorial Convergence Zone (30%)."
2329,319-7,"When projected globally, 3.4 x 10(27)Prochlorococcus cells represent 171 Mt of carbon biomass, with 43% of this global biomass allocated to the upper ocean (0-45 m depth)."
2330,319-8,"Annual cell standing stocks were relatively stable between the years 2003 and 2014, and the contribution of the gyres varies seasonally as gyres expand and contract, tracking changes in light and temperature, with lowest cell abundances during the boreal and austral winter (1.4 x 10(13) cells m(-2)), when surface cell concentrations were highest (9.8 x 10(4) cells mL(-1)), whereas the opposite scenario was observed in spring-summer (2 x 10(13) cells m(-2))."
2331,319-9,"This model provides a three-dimensional view of the abundance of Prochlorococcus cells, revealing that Prochlorococcus contributes significantly to total phytoplankton biomass in the Atlantic Ocean, and can be applied using either in situ measurements at the sea surface (r(2) = 0.83) or remote-sensing observables (r(2) = 0.58)."
2332,32-1,"Laser scanning generates a point cloud from which geometries can be extracted, but most methods struggle to do this automatically, especially for the entirety of an architecturally complex building (as opposed to that of a single facade)."
2333,32-2,"To address this issue, this paper introduces the Improved Slicing Method (ISM), an innovative and computationally-efficient method for three-dimensional building segmentation."
2334,32-3,"The method is also able to detect opening boundaries even on roofs (e.g. chimneys), as well as a building's overall outer boundaries using a local density analysis technique."
2335,32-4,"The proposed procedure is validated by its application to two architecturally complex, historic brick buildings."
2336,32-5,"Accuracies of at least 86% were achieved, with computational times as little as 0.53 s for detecting features from a data set of 5.0 million points."
2337,32-6,"The accuracy more than rivalled the current state of the art, while being up to six times faster and with the further advantage of requiring no manual intervention or reliance on a priori information."
2338,320-1,The climate-induced decrease in fish catches in South Korea has been a big concern over the last decades.
2339,320-2,The increase in sea surface temperature (SST) due to climate change has led to not only a decline in fishery landings but also a shift in the fishing grounds of several fish species.
2340,320-3,"The habitat suitability index (HSI), a reliable indicator of the capacity of a habitant to support selected species, has been widely used to detect and forecast fishing ground formation."
2341,320-4,"In this study, the catch data of the chub mackerel and satellite-derived environmental factors were used to calculate the HSI for the chub mackerel in the South Sea, South Korea."
2342,320-5,"More than 80% of the total catch was found in areas with an SST of 14.72-25.72 degrees C, chlorophyll-a of 0.30-0.92 mg m(-3), and primary production of 523.7-806.46 mg C m(-2) d(-1)."
2343,320-6,"Based on these results, the estimated climatological monthly HSI from 2002 to 2016 clearly showed that the wintering ground of the chub mackerel generally formed in the South Sea of South Korea, coinciding with the catch distribution during the same period."
2344,320-7,This outcome implies that our estimated HSI can yield a reliable prediction of the fishing ground for the chub mackerel in the East/Japan Sea and South Sea of South Korea.
2345,321-1,Passive optical remote sensing of river bathymetry involves establishing a relation between depth and reflectance that can be applied throughout an image to produce a depth map.
2346,321-2,"Building upon the Optimal Band Ratio Analysis (OBRA) framework, we introduce sampling strategies for constructing calibration data sets that lead to strong relationships between an image-derived quantity and depth across a range of depths."
2347,321-3,Progressively excluding observations that exceed a series of cutoff depths from the calibration process improved the accuracy of depth estimates and allowed the maximum detectable depth ( ) to be inferred directly from an image.
2348,321-4,Depth retrieval in two distinct rivers also was enhanced by a stratified version of OBRA that partitions field measurements into a series of depth bins to avoid biases associated with under-representation of shallow areas in typical field data sets.
2349,321-5,"In the shallower, clearer of the two rivers, including the deepest field observations in the calibration data set did not compromise depth retrieval accuracy, suggesting that was not exceeded and the reach could be mapped without gaps."
2350,321-6,"Conversely, in the deeper and more turbid stream, progressive truncation of input depths yielded a plausible estimate of consistent with theoretical calculations based on field measurements of light attenuation by the water column."
2351,321-7,"This result implied that the entire channel, including pools, could not be mapped remotely."
2352,321-8,"However, truncation improved the accuracy of depth estimates in areas shallower than , which comprise the majority of the channel and are of primary interest for many habitat-oriented applications."
2353,322-1,"Biological soil crusts (BSC) encompassing green algae, cyanobacteria, lichens, bryophytes, heterotrophic bacteria and microfungi are keystone species in arid environments because of their role in nitrogen- and carbon-fixation, weathering and soil stabilization, all depending on the photosynthesis of the BSC."
2354,322-2,"Despite their importance, little is known about the BSCs of the Atacama Desert, although especially crustose chlorolichens account for a large proportion of biomass in the arid coastal zone, where photosynthesis is mainly limited due to low water availability."
2355,322-3,"Here, we present the first hyperspectral reflectance data for the most wide-spread BSC species of the southern Atacama Desert."
2356,322-4,"Combining laboratory and field measurements, we establish transfer functions that allow us to estimate net photosynthesis rates for the most common BSC species."
2357,322-5,"We found that spectral differences among species are high, and differences between the background soil and the BSC at inactive stages are low."
2358,322-6,"Additionally, we found that the water absorption feature at 1420 nm is a more robust indicator for photosynthetic activity than the chlorophyll absorption bands."
2359,322-7,"Therefore, we conclude that common vegetation indices must be taken with care to analyze the photosynthesis of BSC with multispectral data."
2360,323-1,Effective feature representations play an important role in remote sensing image analysis tasks.
2361,323-2,"With the rapid progress of deep learning techniques, deep features have been widely applied to remote sensing image understanding in recent years and shown powerful ability in image representation."
2362,323-3,The existing deep feature extraction approaches are usually carried out on the whole image directly.
2363,323-4,"However, such deep feature representation strategies may not effectively capture the local geometric invariance of target regions in remote sensing images."
2364,323-5,"In this paper, we propose a novel region-wise deep feature extraction framework for remote sensing images."
2365,323-6,"First, regions that may contain the target information are extracted from one whole image."
2366,323-7,"Then, these regions are fed into a pre-trained convolutional neural network (CNN) model to extract regional deep features."
2367,323-8,"Finally, the regional deep features are encoded by an improved Vector of Locally Aggregated Descriptors (VLAD) algorithm to generate the feature representation for the image."
2368,323-9,We conducted extensive experiments on remote sensing image classification and retrieval tasks based on the proposed region-wise deep feature extraction framework.
2369,323-10,The comparison results show that the proposed approach is superior to the existing CNN feature extraction methods.
2370,324-1,"China is one of the countries with the most abundant bamboo forest resources in the world, and Zhejiang province is among the top-3 Chinese provinces with richest bamboo forests."
2371,324-2,"For rational bamboo forests management, it is of great significance to study the spatiotemporal dynamic changes of Aboveground Carbon (AGC) stocks of bamboo forest in Zhejiang."
2372,324-3,"In this study, remote sensing variables, such as spectral, vegetation indices and texture features of bamboo forest in Zhejiang, were extracted from 32 Landsat TM and OLI images got from four different years (2000, 2004, 2008 and 2014)."
2373,324-4,These variables were subsequently selected with stepwise regression method to build an estimation model of AGC of the bamboo forests.
2374,324-5,The results showed that (1) the accuracy of bamboo forest remote sensing information extracted from the four different years was high with a classification accuracy of >76.26% and an accuracy of users of >91.62%.
2375,324-6,"The classification area of bamboo forest was highly consistent with the area from forest resource inventory, and the area accuracy was over 96.50%; (2) the estimation model performed well in predicting the AGC in Zhejiang for different years."
2376,324-7,"The correlation coefficient for estimated and measured AGC was between 63% and 72% with low root mean square error; (3) the derived AGC of the bamboo forests in Zhejiang province increased gradually from 2000 to 2014, with the AGC density of 6.75 Mgha(-1), 10.95 Mgha(-1), 15.25 Mgha(-1) and 19.07 Mgha(-1) respectively, and the average annual growth of 0.88 Mgha(-1)."
2377,324-8,The spatiotemporal evolution of bamboo forest AGC in Zhejiang province had a close relationship with the gradual expansion of bamboo forest in the province and the differentiation of management levels in different regions.
2378,325-1,Carbon sink estimation and ecological assessment of forests require accurate forest type mapping.
2379,325-2,"The traditional survey method is time consuming and labor intensive, and the remote sensing method with high-resolution, multi-spectral commercial satellite images has high cost and low availability."
2380,325-3,"In this study, we explore and evaluate the potential of freely-available multi-source imagery to identify forest types with an object-based random forest algorithm."
2381,325-4,"These datasets included Sentinel-2A (S2), Sentinel-1A (S1) in dual polarization, one-arc-second Shuttle Radar Topographic Mission Digital Elevation (DEM) and multi-temporal Landsat-8 images (L8)."
2382,325-5,"We tested seven different sets of explanatory variables for classifying eight forest types in Wuhan, China."
2383,325-6,"The results indicate that single-sensor (S2) or single-day data (L8) cannot obtain satisfactory results; the overall accuracy was 54.31% and 50.00%, respectively."
2384,325-7,"Compared with the classification using only Sentinel-2 data, the overall accuracy increased by approximately 15.23% and 22.51%, respectively, by adding DEM and multi-temporal Landsat-8 imagery."
2385,325-8,"The highest accuracy (82.78%) was achieved with fused imagery, the terrain and multi-temporal data contributing the most to forest type identification."
2386,325-9,"These encouraging results demonstrate that freely-accessible multi-source remotely-sensed data have tremendous potential in forest type identification, which can effectively support monitoring and management of forest ecological resources at regional or global scales."
2387,326-1,Land cover change detection (LCCD) based on bi-temporal remote sensing images plays an important role in the inventory of land cover change.
2388,326-2,"Due to the benefit of having spatial dependency properties within the image space while using remote sensing images for detecting land cover change, many contextual information-based change detection methods have been proposed in past decades."
2389,326-3,"However, there is still a space for improvement in accuracies and usability of LCCD."
2390,326-4,"In this paper, a LCCD method based on adaptive contextual information is proposed."
2391,326-5,"First, an adaptive region is constructed by gradually detecting the spectral similarity surrounding a central pixel."
2392,326-6,"Second, the Euclidean distance between pairwise extended regions is calculated to measure the change magnitude between the pairwise central pixels of bi-temporal images."
2393,326-7,All the bi-temporal images are scanned pixel by pixel so the change magnitude image (CMI) can be generated.
2394,326-8,"Then, the Otsu or a manual threshold is employed to acquire the binary change detection map (BCDM)."
2395,326-9,The detection accuracies of the proposed approach are investigated by three land cover change cases with Landsat bi-temporal remote sensing images and aerial images with very high spatial resolution (0.5 m/pixel).
2396,326-10,"In comparison to several widely used change detection methods, the proposed approach can produce a land cover change inventory map with a competitive accuracy."
2397,327-1,The Andaman Sea in the Indian Ocean has been a classical study region for Internal Solitary Waves (ISWs) for several decades.
2398,327-2,"Papers such as Osborne and Burch (1980) usually describe mode-1 packets of ISWs propagating eastwards, separated by distances of around 100 km."
2399,327-3,"In this paper, we report on shorter period solitary-like waves that are consistent with a mode-2 vertical structure, which are observed along the Ten Degree Channel, and propagate side-by-side the usual large mode-1 solitary wave packets."
2400,327-4,"The mode-2 waves are identified in TerraSAR-X images because of their distinct surface signatures, which are reversed when compared to those that are typical of mode-1 ISWs in the ocean."
2401,327-5,"These newly observed regularly-spaced packets of ISW-like waves are characterized by average separations of roughly 30 km, which are far from the nominal mode-1 or even the mode-2 internal tidal wavelengths."
2402,327-6,"On some occasions, five consecutive and regularly spaced mode-2 ISW-like wave envelopes were observed simultaneously in the same TerraSAR-X image."
2403,327-7,"This fact points to a tidal generation mechanism somewhere in the west shallow ridges, south of the Nicobar Islands."
2404,327-8,"Furthermore, it implies that unusually long-lived mode-2 waves can be found throughout the majority of the fortnightly tidal cycle."
2405,327-9,Ray tracing techniques are used to identify internal tidal beams as a possible explanation for the generation of the mode-2 solitary-like waves when the internal tidal beam interacts with the ocean pycnocline.
2406,327-10,"Linear theory suggests that resonant coupling with long internal waves of higher-mode could explain the longevity of the mode-2 waves, which propagate for more than 100 km."
2407,327-11,"Owing to their small-scale dimensions, the mode-2 waves may have been overlooked in previous remote sensing images."
2408,327-12,"The enhanced radiometric resolution of the TerraSAR-X, alongside its wide coverage and detailed spatial resolutions, make it an ideal observational tool for the present study."
2409,328-1,Reservoir construction and land use change are altering sediment transport within river systems at a global scale.
2410,328-2,"Changes in sediment transport can impact river morphology, aquatic ecosystems, and ultimately the growth and retreat of delta environments."
2411,328-3,"The Lower Mekong Basin is crucial to five neighboring countries for transportation, energy production, sustainable water supply, and food production."
2412,328-4,"In response, countries have coordinated to develop programs for regional scale water quality monitoring that including surface sediment concentrations (SSSC); however, these programs are based on a limited number of point measurements and due to resource limitations, cannot provide comprehensive insights into sediment transport across all strategic locations within the Lower Mekong Basin."
2413,328-5,"To augment in situ SSSC data from the current monitoring program, we developed an empirical model to estimate SSSC across the Lower Mekong Basin from Landsat observations."
2414,328-6,"Model validation revealed that remotely sensed SSSC estimates captured the spatial and temporal dynamics in a range of aquatic environments (main stem of Mekong river, tributary systems, Mekong Floodplain, and reservoirs) while, on average, slightly underestimating SSSC by about 2 mgL-1across all settings."
2415,328-7,"The operational SSSC model was developed and implemented using Google Earth Engine and Google App Engine was used to host an online application that allows users, without any knowledge of remote sensing, to access SSSC data across the region."
2416,328-8,"Expanded access to SSSC data should be particularly helpful for resource managers and other stakeholders seeking to understand the dynamics between surface sediment concentrations and land use conversions, water policy, and energy production in a globally strategic region."
2417,329-1,We present here parameterizations of particulate and phytoplankton absorption coefficients as functions of pigment concentrations (Tchla) in Sognefjord and Trondheimsfjord along the northwestern coast of Norway.
2418,329-2,The total particulate and non-algal optical densities were measured via quantitative filter technique (QFT) in a spectrophotometer with integrating sphere.
2419,329-3,"The spectral parameter coefficients A() and E() of the power law describing variations of particulate and phytoplankton absorption coefficients as a function of Tchla, were not only different from those provided for open ocean case 1 waters, but also exhibited differences in the two fjords under investigation."
2420,329-4,"Considering the influence of glacial meltwater leading to increased inorganic sediment load in Sognefjord we investigate differences in two different parameterizations, developed by excluding and including inner Sognefjord stations."
2421,329-5,Tchla are modelled to test the parameterizations and validated against data from the same cruise and that from a repeated campaign.
2422,329-6,Being less influenced by non-algal particles parameterizations performed well in Trondheimsfjord and yielded high coefficients of determination (R-2) of modelled vs. measured Tchla.
2423,329-7,"In Sognefjord, the modelled vs. measured Tchla resulted in better R-2 with parameter coefficients developed excluding the inner-fjord stations influenced by glacial meltwater influx."
2424,33-1,Indoor building models are essential in many indoor applications.
2425,33-2,"These models are composed of the primitives of the buildings, such as the ceilings, floors, walls, windows, and doors, but not the movable objects in the indoor spaces, such as furniture."
2426,33-3,"This paper presents, for indoor environments, a novel semantic line framework-based modeling building method using backpacked laser scanning point cloud data."
2427,33-4,"The proposed method first semantically labels the raw point clouds into the walls, ceiling, floor, and other objects."
2428,33-5,Then line structures are extracted from the labeled points to achieve an initial description of the building line framework.
2429,33-6,"To optimize the detected line structures caused by furniture occlusion, a conditional Generative Adversarial Nets (cGAN) deep learning model is constructed."
2430,33-7,"The line framework optimization model includes structure completion, extrusion removal, and regularization."
2431,33-8,The result of optimization is also derived from a quality evaluation of the point cloud.
2432,33-9,"Thus, the data collection and building model representation become a united task-driven loop."
2433,33-10,The proposed method eventually outputs a semantic line framework model and provides a layout for the interior of the building.
2434,33-11,Experiments show that the proposed method effectively extracts the line framework from different indoor scenes.
2435,330-1,"The purpose of this research was to use empirical models to monitor temporal dynamics of soil moisture in a peatland using remotely sensed imagery, and to determine the predictive accuracy of the approach on dates outside the time series through statistically independent validation."
2436,330-2,"A time series of seven Moderate Resolution Imaging Spectroradiometer (MODIS) and Synthetic Aperture Radar (SAR) images were collected along with concurrent field measurements of soil moisture over one growing season, and soil moisture retrieval was tested using Linear Mixed Effects models (LMEs)."
2437,330-3,"A single-date airborne Light Detection and Ranging (LiDAR) survey was incorporated into the analysis, along with temporally varying environmental covariates (Drought Code, Time Since Last Rain, Day of Year)."
2438,330-4,"LMEs allowed repeated measures to be accounted for at individual sampling sites, as well as soil moisture differences associated with peatland classes."
2439,330-5,"Covariates provided a large amount of explanatory power in models; however, SAR imagery contributed to only a moderate improvement in soil moisture predictions (marginal R-2 = 0.07; conditional R-2 = 0.7, independently validated R-2 = 0.36)."
2440,330-6,"The use of LMEs allows for a more accurate characterization of soil moisture as a function of specific measurement sites, peatland classes and measurement dates on model strength and predictive power."
2441,330-7,"For intensively monitored peatlands, SAR data is best analyzed in conjunction with peatland Class (e.g., derived from an ecosystem classification map) to estimate the spatial distribution of surface soil moisture, provided there is a ground-based monitoring network with a sufficiently fine spatial and temporal resolution to fit the LME models."
2442,331-1,Multiple satellite-based earth observations and traditional station data along with the Soil & Water Assessment Tool (SWAT) hydrologic model were employed to enhance the Lower Mekong River Basin region's hydrological decision support system.
2443,331-2,"A nearest neighbor approximation methodology was introduced to fill the Integrated Multi-satellite Retrieval for the Global Precipitation Measurement mission (IMERG) grid points from 2001 to 2014, together with the Tropical Rainfall Measurement Mission (TRMM) data points for continuous precipitation forcing for our hydrological decision support system."
2444,331-3,A software tool to access and format satellite-based earth observation systems of precipitation and minimum and maximum air temperatures was developed and is presented.
2445,331-4,Our results suggest that the model-simulated streamflow utilizing TRMM and IMERG forcing data was able to capture the variability of the observed streamflow patterns in the Lower Mekong better than model-simulated streamflow with in-situ precipitation station data.
2446,331-5,We also present satellite-based and in-situ precipitation adjustment maps that can serve to correct precipitation data for the Lower Mekong region for use in other applications.
2447,331-6,"The inconsistency, scarcity, poor spatial representation, difficult access and incompleteness of the available in-situ precipitation data for the Mekong region make it imperative to adopt satellite-based earth observations to pursue hydrologic modeling."
2448,332-1,Knowledge of the spatial and temporal variability of near-surface water vapor is of great importance to successfully model reliable radio communications systems and forecast atmospheric phenomena such as convective initiation and boundary layer processes.
2449,332-2,"However, most current methods to measure atmospheric moisture variations hardly provide the temporal and spatial resolutions required for detection of such atmospheric processes."
2450,332-3,"Recently, considering the high correlation between refractivity variations and water vapor pressure variations at warm temperatures, and the good temporal and spatial resolution that weather radars provide, the measurement of the refractivity with radar became of interest."
2451,332-4,"Firstly, it was proposed to estimate refractivity variations from radar phase measurements of ground-based stationary targets returns."
2452,332-5,"For that, it was considered that the backscattering from ground targets is stationary and the vertical gradient of the refractivity could be neglected."
2453,332-6,Initial experiments showed good results over flat terrain when the radar and target heights are similar.
2454,332-7,"However, the need to consider the non-zero vertical gradient of the refractivity over hilly terrain is clear."
2455,332-8,"Up to date, the methods proposed consider previous estimation of the refractivity gradient in order to correct the measured phases before the refractivity estimation."
2456,332-9,"In this paper, joint estimation of the refractivity variations at the radar height and the refractivity vertical gradient variations using scan-to-scan phase measurement variations is proposed."
2457,332-10,"To reduce the noisiness of the estimates, a least squares method is used."
2458,332-11,"Importantly, to apply this algorithm, it is not necessary to modify the radar scanning mode."
2459,332-12,"For the purpose of this study, radar data obtained during the Refractivity Experiment for H2O Research and Collaborative Operational Technology Transfer (REFRACTT_2006), held in northeastern Colorado (USA), are used."
2460,332-13,"The refractivity estimates obtained show a good performance of the algorithm proposed compared to the refractivity derived from two automatic weather stations located close to the radar, demonstrating the possibility of radar based refractivity estimation in hilly terrain and non-homogeneous atmosphere with high spatial resolution."
2461,333-1,Radar altimetry provides unique information on water stages of inland hydro-systems.
2462,333-2,"In this study, the performance of seven altimetry missions, among the most commonly used in land hydrology (i.e., European Remote-Sensing Satellite-2 (ERS-2), ENVIronment SATellite (ENVISAT), Satellite with Argos and ALtika (SARAL), Jason-1, Jason-2, Jason-3 and Sentinel-3A), are assessed using records from a dense in situ network composed of 19 gauge stations in the Inner Niger Delta (IND) from 1995 to 2017."
2463,333-3,Results show an overall very good agreement between altimetry-based and in situ water levels with correlation coefficient (R) greater than 0.8 in 80% of the cases and Root Mean Square Error (RMSE) lower than 0.4 m in 48% of cases.
2464,333-4,"Better agreement is found for the recently launched missions such as SARAL, Jason-3 and Sentinel-3A than for former missions, indicating the advance of the use of the Ka-band for SARAL and of the Synthetic-aperture Radar (SAR) mode for Sentinel-3A."
2465,333-5,Cross-correlation analysis performed between water levels from the same altimetry mission leads to time-lags between the upstream and the downstream part of the Inner Niger Delta of around two months that can be related to the time residence of water in the drainage area.
2466,334-1,"Up-to-date maps of a city's urban structure types (USTs) are very important for effective planning, as well as for different studies and applications."
2467,334-2,We present an approach for the classification of USTs at the level of urban blocks based on high-resolution spaceborne radar imagery.
2468,334-3,Images obtained at the satellite's ascending and descending orbits were used for extracting line and polygon features from each block.
2469,334-4,"Most of the attributes considered in the classification concern the geometry of these features, as well as their spatial disposition inside the blocks."
2470,334-5,"Furthermore, assuming the UST classes of neighboring blocks are probabilistically dependent, we explored the framework of probabilistic graphical models and propose different context-based classification models."
2471,334-6,"These models differ with respect to (i) their type, i.e., Markov or conditional random fields, (ii) their parameterization and (iii) the criterion applied for establishing pairwise neighboring relationships between blocks."
2472,334-7,"In our experiments, 1,695 blocks from the city of Munich (Germany) and five representative UST classes were considered."
2473,334-8,A standard classification performed with the Random Forest algorithm achieved an overall accuracy of nearly 70%.
2474,334-9,All context-based classifications achieved overall accuracies up to 7% higher than that.
2475,334-10,The results indicate that denser pairwise block-neighborhood structures lead to better results and that the accuracy improvement is higher when the strength of the contextual influences is proportional to the similarity of the neighboring blocks attributes.
2476,335-1,Biodiversity loss remains a global challenge despite international commitment to the United Nations Convention on Biodiversity.
2477,335-2,Biodiversity monitoring methods are often limited in their geographical coverage or thematic content.
2478,335-3,"Furthermore, remote sensing-based integrated monitoring methods mostly attempt to determine species diversity from habitat heterogeneity somewhat reflected in the spectral diversity of the image used."
2479,335-4,"Up to date, there has been no standardized method for monitoring biodiversity against the backdrop of ecosystem or environmental pressures."
2480,335-5,This study presents a new method for monitoring the impact of oil pollution an environmental pressure on biodiversity at regional scale and presents a case study in the Niger delta region of Nigeria.
2481,335-6,It integrates satellite remote sensing and field data to develop a set of spectral metrics for biodiversity monitoring.
2482,335-7,"Using vascular plants of various lifeforms observed on polluted and unpolluted (control) locations, as surrogates for biodiversity, the normalized difference vegetation vigour index (NDVVI) variants were estimated from Hyperion wavelengths sensitive to petroleum hydrocarbons and evaluated for potential use in biodiversity monitoring schemes."
2483,335-8,The NDVVI ranges from 0 to 1 and stems from the presupposition that increasing chlorophyll absorption in the green vegetation can be used as a predictor to model vascular plant species diversity.
2484,335-9,The performances of NDVVI variants were compared to traditional narrowband vegetation indices (NBVIs).
2485,335-10,"The results show strong links between vascular plant species diversity and primary productivity of vegetation quantified by the chlorophyll content, vegetation vigour and abundance."
2486,335-11,An NDVVI-based model gave much more accurate predictions of species diversity than traditional NBVIs (R-squared and prediction square error (PSE) respectively for Shannon's diversity = 0.54 and 0.69 for NDVVIs and 0.14 and 0.9 for NBVIs).
2487,335-12,We conclude that NDVVI is a superior remote sensing index for monitoring biodiversity indicators in oil-polluted areas than traditional NBVIs.
2488,336-1,"Convolutional neural networks (CNNs) can adapt to more complex data, extract deeper characteristics from images, and achieve higher classification accuracy in remote sensing image scene classification and object detection compared to traditional shallow-model methods."
2489,336-2,"However, directly applying common-structure CNNs to pixel-based remote sensing image classification will lead to boundary or outline distortions of the land cover and consumes enormous computation time in the image classification stage."
2490,336-3,"To solve this problem, we propose a high-resolution remote sensing image classification method based on CNN and the restricted conditional random field algorithm (CNN-RCRF)."
2491,336-4,CNN-RCRF adopts CNN superpixel classification instead of pixel-based classification and uses the restricted conditional random field algorithm (RCRF) to refine the superpixel result image into a pixel-based result.
2492,336-5,The proposed method not only takes advantage of the classification ability of CNNs but can also avoid boundary or outline distortions of the land cover and greatly reduce computation time in classifying images.
2493,336-6,"The effectiveness of the proposed method is tested with two high-resolution remote sensing images, and the experimental results show that the CNN-RCRF outperforms the existing traditional methods in terms of overall accuracy, and CNN-RCRF's computation time is much less than that of traditional pixel-based deep-model methods."
2494,337-1,"Landsat and MODIS data have been widely utilized in many remote sensing applications, however, the trade-off between the spatial resolution and temporal frequency has limited their capacities in monitoring detailed spatio-temporal dynamics."
2495,337-2,"Spatio-temporal fusion methods based on a linear model that considers the differences between fine- and coarse-spatial-resolution images as linear can effectively solve this trade-off problem, yet the existing linear fusion methods either regard the coefficients of the linear model as constants or have adopted regression methods to calculate the coefficients, both of which may introduce some errors in the fusion process."
2496,337-3,"In this paper, we proposed an enhanced linear spatio-temporal fusion method (ELSTFM) to improve the data fusion accuracy."
2497,337-4,"In the ELSTFM, it is not necessary to calculate the slope of the linear model, and the intercept, which can be deemed as the residual caused by systematic biases, is calculated based on spectral unmixing theory."
2498,337-5,"Additionally, spectrally similar pixels in a given fine-spatial-resolution pixel's neighborhood and their corresponding weights were used in the proposed method to mitigate block effects."
2499,337-6,Landsat-7/ETM+ and 8-day composite MODIS reflectance data covering two study sites with heterogeneous and homogenous landscapes were selected to validate the proposed method.
2500,337-7,"Compared to three other typical spatio-temporal fusion methods visually and quantitatively, the predicted images obtained from ELSTFM could acquire better results for the two selected study sites."
2501,337-8,"Furthermore, the resampling methods used to resample MODIS to the same spatial resolution of Landsat could slightly, but did not significantly influence the fusion accuracy, and the distributions of slopes of different bands for the two study sites could all be deemed as normal distributions with a mean value close to 1."
2502,337-9,The performance of ELSTFM depends on the accuracy of residual calculation at fine-resolution and large landscape changes may influence the fusion accuracy.
2503,338-1,Antarctica is a region of the world where climate change is visible in the rapid melting of glaciers.
2504,338-2,"This is particularly evident in marginal zones, where the pace of glacial retreat has systematically accelerated."
2505,338-3,The effective mapping of these changes is possible with the use of remote sensing methods.
2506,338-4,"This study assesses changes in glacier margin positions between 1979 and 2018 in the Antarctic Specially Protected Area 128 (ASPA-128) on King George Island, South Shetland Islands, Antarctica."
2507,338-5,"In 1979, 19.8 km(2) of the study area was glaciated."
2508,338-6,"Over the following 39 years, an area of 6.1 km(2) became ice-free, impacting local ecosystems both on land and in Admiralty Bay."
2509,338-7,The reduction in glacier extent was different in time and depended on the glacier type.
2510,338-8,Land-terminating glaciers had the fastest retreat rates below 200 m a.s.l. and were influenced mostly by surface melting.
2511,338-9,"The reduction of tidewater glaciers occurred primarily in areas below 100 m a.s.l., with the most pronounced ice extent decreases occurring below 50 m a.s.l."
2512,338-10,"The observed rates of front retreat suggest that glacier retreat rates were fastest between 1989-2001 and 2007-2011, with reduced retreat rates between 2001 and 2007."
2513,338-11,"During the last 7 years, the lowest rate of regression was recorded in the entire analysed period (1979-2018)."
2514,338-12,Changes in the areal extent of glaciers were compared with the climate record available for King George Island.
2515,338-13,The observed fluctuations in glacier retreat rates could be correlated to oscillations in annual Positive Degree-Days.
2516,338-14,"The spatial analyses were based on aerial photographs (1956, 1979), theodolite measurements (1989), GPS survey (2001, 2007), and satellite images (2011, 2018)."
2517,339-1,Convolutional neural networks (CNNs) have been increasingly used in remote sensing scene classification/recognition.
2518,339-2,"The conventional CNNs are sensitive to the rotation of the image scene, which will inevitably result in the misclassification of remote sensing scene images that belong to the same category."
2519,339-3,"In this work, we equip the networks with a new pooling strategy, concentric circle pooling, to alleviate the above problem."
2520,339-4,"The new network structure, called CCP-net can generate a concentric circle-based spatial-rotation-invariant representation of an image, hence improving the classification accuracy."
2521,339-5,"The square kernel is adopted to approximate the circle kernels in concentric circle pooling, which is much more efficient and suitable for CNNs to propagate gradients."
2522,339-6,"We implement the training of the proposed network structure with standard back-propagation, thus CCP-net is an end-to-end trainable CNNs."
2523,339-7,"With these advantages, CCP-net should in general improve CNN-based remote sensing scene classification methods."
2524,339-8,Experiments using two publicly available remote sensing scene datasets demonstrate that using CCP-net can achieve competitive classification results compared with the state-of-art methods.
2525,34-1,"In this work, we propose a novel approach to prioritize the depth map computation of multi-view stereo (MVS) to obtain compact 3D point clouds of high quality and completeness at low computational cost."
2526,34-2,Our prioritization approach operates before the MVS algorithm is executed and consists of two steps.
2527,34-3,"In the first step, we aim to find a good set of matching partners for each view."
2528,34-4,"In the second step, we rank the resulting view clusters ((i.e. key views with matching partners)) according to their impact on the fulfillment of desired quality parameters such as completeness, ground resolution and accuracy."
2529,34-5,"Additional to geometric analysis, we use a novel machine learning technique for training a confidence predictor."
2530,34-6,The purpose of this confidence predictor is to estimate the chances of a successful depth reconstruction for each pixel in each image for one specific MVS algorithm based on the RGB images and the image constellation.
2531,34-7,"The underlying machine learning technique does not require any ground truth or manually labeled data for training, but instead adapts ideas from depth map fusion for providing a supervision signal."
2532,34-8,The trained confidence predictor allows us to evaluate the quality of image constellations and their potential impact to the resulting 3D reconstruction and thus builds a solid foundation for our prioritization approach.
2533,34-9,"In our experiments, we are thus able to reach more than 70% of the maximal reachable quality fulfillment using only 5% of the available images as key views."
2534,34-10,"For evaluating our approach within and across different domains, we use two completely different scenarios, i.e. cultural heritage preservation and reconstruction of single family houses."
2535,340-1,The thermal environment in residential areas is directly related to the living quality of residents.
2536,340-2,"Therefore, it is important to understand thermal heterogeneity and ways to regulate temperature in residential neighborhoods."
2537,340-3,"We investigated the spatial heterogeneity and temporal dynamics of air temperatures in 20 residential neighborhoods within the 5th ring road of Beijing, China."
2538,340-4,We further explored how the variations in air temperature were related to the patterns of the surrounding greenspace at different scales.
2539,340-5,"We found that: (1) large air temperature differences existed among residential neighborhoods, with hourly maximum differences in air temperature reaching 5.30 degrees C on hot summer days; (2) not only the percentage but also the spatial configuration (e.g., edge density) of greenspace affected the local air temperature; and (3) the effects of spatial greenspace patterns on air temperature were scale dependent and varied by season."
2540,340-6,"For example, increasing the proportion of greenspace in surrounding areas within a 100-m radius and increasing the edge density within radii from 500 to 1000 m could lower air temperatures in summer but not affect air temperatures in winter."
2541,340-7,"In addition, decreasing the edge density of greenspaces within a 100-m radius of the surrounding areas would lead to an increase in air temperature in winter but not affect the air temperature in summer."
2542,340-8,"These results extend our understanding of thermal environments and their relationships with greenspace patterns at the microscale (i.e., residential neighborhoods)."
2543,340-9,They also provide useful information for urban planners to optimize greenspace patterns under better thermal conditions at the neighborhood scale.
2544,341-1,Leaf area index (LAI) is an important parameter to describe the capacity of forests to intercept light and thus affects the microclimate and photosynthetic capacity of canopies.
2545,341-2,"In general, tropical forests have a higher leaf area index and it is a challenge to estimate LAI in a forest with a very dense canopy."
2546,341-3,"In this study, it is assumed that the traditional Light Detection and Ranging (LiDAR)-derived fractional vegetation cover (fCover) has weak relationship with leaf area index in a dense forest."
2547,341-4,We propose a partial least squares (PLS) regression model using the height percentile metrics derived from airborne LiDAR data to estimate the LAI of a dense forest.
2548,341-5,Ground inventory and airborne LiDAR data collected in a selectively logged tropical forest area in Eastern Amazonia are used to map LAI from the plot level to the landscape scale.
2549,341-6,"The results indicate that the fCover, derived from the first return or the last return, has no significant correlations with the ground-based LAI."
2550,341-7,The PLS model evaluated by the leave-one-out validation shows that the estimated LAI is significantly correlated with the ground-based LAI with an R-2 of 0.58 and a root mean square error (RMSE) of 1.13.
2551,341-8,A data comparison indicates that the Moderate Resolution Imaging Spectrometer (MODIS) LAI underestimates the landscape-level LAI by about 22%.
2552,341-9,"The MODIS quality control data show that in the selected tile, the cloud state is not the primary factor affecting the MODIS LAI performance; rather, the LAI from the main radiative transfer (RT) algorithm contributes much to the underestimation of the LAI in the tropical forest."
2553,341-10,"In addition, the results show that the LiDAR-based LAI has a better response to the logging activities than the MODIS-based LAI, and that the leaf area reduction caused by logging is about 13%."
2554,341-11,"In contrast, the MODIS-based LAI exhibits no apparent spatial correlation with the LiDAR-based LAI."
2555,341-12,It is suggested that the main algorithm of MODIS should be improved with regard to tropical forests.
2556,341-13,The significance of this study is the proposal of a framework to produce ground-based LAI using forest inventory data and determine the plot-level LAI at the airborne and satellite scale using LiDAR data.
2557,342-1,"Satellite-based retrievals offer the most cost-effective way to comprehensively map the surface albedo of the Earth, a key variable for understanding the dynamics of radiative energy interactions in the atmosphere-surface system."
2558,342-2,Surface albedo retrievals have commonly been designed separately for each different spaceborne optical imager.
2559,342-3,"Here, we introduce a novel type of processing framework that combines the data from two polar-orbiting optical imager families, the Advanced Very High-Resolution Radiometer (AVHRR) and Moderate Resolution Imaging Spectroradiometer (MODIS)."
2560,342-4,"The goal of the paper is to demonstrate that multisensor albedo retrievals can provide a significant reduction in the sampling time required for a robust and comprehensive surface albedo retrieval, without a major degradation in retrieval accuracy, as compared to state-of-the-art single-sensor retrievals."
2561,342-5,We evaluated the multisensor retrievals against reference in situ albedo measurements and compare them with existing datasets.
2562,342-6,"The results show that global land surface albedo retrievals with a sampling period of 10 days can offer near-complete spatial coverage, with a retrieval bias mostly comparable to existing single sensor datasets, except for bright surfaces (deserts and snow) where the retrieval framework shows degraded performance because of atmospheric correction design compromises."
2563,342-7,"A level difference is found between the single sensor datasets and the demonstrator developed here, pointing towards a need for further work in the atmospheric correction, particularly over bright surfaces, and inter-sensor radiance homogenization."
2564,342-8,The introduced framework is expandable to include other sensors in the future.
2565,343-1,This study evaluates the potential of high resolution hyperspectral airborne imagery to capture within-field variability of durum wheat grain yield (GY) and grain protein content (GPC) in two commercial fields in the Yaqui Valley (northwestern Mexico).
2566,343-2,"Through a weekly/biweekly airborne flight campaign, we acquired 10 mosaics with a micro-hyperspectral Vis-NIR imaging sensor ranging from 400-850 nanometres (nm)."
2567,343-3,"Just before harvest, 114 georeferenced grain samples were obtained manually."
2568,343-4,"Using spectral exploratory analysis, we calculated narrow-band physiological spectral indicesnormalized difference spectral index (NDSI) and ratio spectral index (RSI)from every single hyperspectral mosaic using complete two by two combinations of wavelengths."
2569,343-5,We applied two methods for the multi-temporal hyperspectral exploratory analysis: (a) Temporal Principal Component Analysis (tPCA) on wavelengths across all images and (b) the integration of vegetation indices over time based on area under the curve (AUC) calculations.
2570,343-6,"For GY, the best R-2 (0.32) were found using both the spectral (NDSIRi, 750 to 840 nm and Rj, +/- 720-736 nm) and the multi-temporal AUC exploratory analysis (EVI and OSAVI through AUC) methods."
2571,343-7,"For GPC, all exploratory analysis methods tested revealed (a) a low to very low coefficient of determination (R-2 0.21), (b) a relatively low overall prediction error (RMSE: 0.45-0.49%), compared to results from other literature studies, and"
2572,344-1,The worst forest fire in South Korea occurred in April 2000 on the eastern coast.
2573,344-2,"Forest recovery works were conducted until 2005, and the forest has been monitored since the fire."
2574,344-3,Remote sensing techniques have been used to detect the burned areas and to evaluate the recovery-time point of the post-fire processes during the past 18 years.
2575,344-4,"We used three indices, Normalized Burn Ratio (NBR), Normalized Difference Vegetation Index (NDVI), and Gross Primary Production (GPP), to temporally monitor a burned area in terms of its moisture condition, vegetation biomass, and photosynthetic activity, respectively."
2576,344-5,The change of those three indices by forest recovery processes was relatively analyzed using an unburned reference area.
2577,344-6,The selected unburned area had similar characteristics to the burned area prior to the forest fire.
2578,344-7,"The temporal patterns of NBR and NDVI, not only showed the forest recovery process as a result of forest management, but also statistically distinguished the recovery periods at the regions of low, moderate, and high fire severity."
2579,344-8,"The NBR2.1 for all areas, calculated using 2.1 m wavelengths, reached the unburned state in 2008."
2580,344-9,"The NDVI for areas with low and moderate fire severity levels became significantly equal to the unburned state in 2009 (p > 0.05), but areas with high severity levels did not reach the unburned state until 2017."
2581,344-10,"This indicated that the surface and vegetation moisture conditions recovered to the unburned state about 8 years after the fire event, while vegetation biomass and health required a longer time to recover, particularly for high severity regions."
2582,344-11,"In the case of GPP, it rapidly recovered after about 3 years."
2583,344-12,"Then, the steady increase in GPP surpassed the GPP of the reference area in 2015 because of the rapid growth and high photosynthetic activity of young forests."
2584,344-13,"Therefore, the concluding scientific message is that, because the recovery-time point for each component of the forest ecosystem is different, using only one satellite-based indicator will not be suitable to understand the post-fire recovery process."
2585,344-14,"NBR, NDVI, and GPP can be combined."
2586,344-15,Further studies will require more approaches using various terms of indices.
2587,345-1,The availability of precipitation data is the key driver in the application of hydrological models when simulating streamflow.
2588,345-2,Ground weather stations are regularly used to measure precipitation.
2589,345-3,"However, spatial coverage is often limited in low-population areas and mountain areas."
2590,345-4,"To overcome this limitation, gridded datasets from remote sensing have been widely used."
2591,345-5,"This study evaluates four widely used global precipitation datasets (GPDs): The Tropical Rainfall Measuring Mission (TRMM) 3B43, the Climate Forecast System Reanalysis (CFSR), the Precipitation Estimation from Remotely Sensed Information using Artificial Neural Networks (PERSIANN), and the Multi-Source Weighted-Ensemble Precipitation (MSWEP), against point gauge and gridded dataset observations using multiple monthly water balance models (MWBMs) in four different meso-scale basins that cover the main climatic zones of Peninsular Spain."
2592,345-6,The volumes of precipitation obtained from the GPDs tend to be smaller than those from the gauged data.
2593,345-7,"Results underscore the superiority of the national gridded dataset, although the TRMM provides satisfactory results in simulating streamflow, reaching similar Nash-Sutcliffe values, between 0.70 and 0.95, and an average total volume error of 12% when using the GR2M model."
2594,345-8,"The performance of GPDs highly depends on the climate, so that the more humid the watershed is, the better results can be achieved."
2595,345-9,The procedures used can be applied in regions with similar case studies to more accurately assess the resources within a system in which there is scarcity of recorded data available.
2596,346-1,Field net primary productivity (NPP) is useful in research modeling of regional and global carbon cycles and for validating results by remote sensing or process-based models.
2597,346-2,"In this study, we used multiple models of NPP estimation and vegetation classification methods to study Chinese vegetation NPP characteristics, trends, and drivers using 7618 field measurements from the 1960s, 1980s, and 2000s."
2598,346-3,"The values of other relevant NPP models, as well as process-based simulation and remote sensing models, were compared."
2599,346-4,"Our results showed that NPP ranged from 3 to 12,407 gCm(-2)year(-1) with a mean value of 571 gCm(-2)year(-1)."
2600,346-5,Vegetation NPP gradually decreased from the southeast to the northwest.
2601,346-6,"Forest, farmland, and grassland NPP was 1152, 294, and 518 gCm(-2)year(-1), respectively."
2602,346-7,Total NPP of grassland was higher than that of farmland.
2603,346-8,"Total terrestrial NPP decreased from 3.58 to 3.41 Pg Cyear(-1) from the 1960s to the 2000s, a decadal decrease of 4.7%."
2604,346-9,"Total NPP in forests and grasslands consistently showed a decreasing trend and decreased by 0.46 Pg Cyear(-1)and 0.16 Pg Cyear(-1), respectively, whereas NPP for farmland showed an opposite trend, with a growth of 0.45 Pg Cyear(-1)."
2605,346-10,"Our research findings filled gaps in the information regarding NPP for the entire landmass of China based on field data from a long-term time series and provide valuable information and a basis for validation analyses by remote sensing models, as well as a robust quantification of carbon estimation to anticipate future development at the national and global scale."
2606,347-1,Benchmark datasets are essential for developing and evaluating remote sensing image retrieval (RSIR) approaches.
2607,347-2,"However, most of the existing datasets are single-labeled, with each image in these datasets being annotated by a single label representing the most significant semantic content of the image."
2608,347-3,"This is sufficient for simple problems, such as distinguishing between a building and a beach, but multiple labels are required for more complex problems, such as RSIR."
2609,347-4,This motivated us to present a new benchmark dataset termed MLRSIR that was labeled from an existing single-labeled remote sensing archive.
2610,347-5,"MLRSIR contained a total of 17 classes, and each image had at least one of 17 pre-defined labels."
2611,347-6,We evaluated the performance of RSIR methods ranging from traditional handcrafted feature-based methods to deep-learning-based ones on MLRSIR.
2612,347-7,"More specifically, we compared the performances of RSIR methods from both single-label and multi-label perspectives."
2613,347-8,"These results presented the advantages of multiple labels over single labels for interpreting complex remote sensing images, and serve as a baseline for future research on multi-label RSIR."
2614,348-1,"The scanning infrared focal plane array (IRFPA) suffers from stripe-like non-uniformity due to the usage of many detectors, especially when working with a large time scale."
2615,348-2,Typical calibration systems tend to block the sensor aperture and expose the detectors to an on-board blackbody calibration source.
2616,348-3,They may also point at deep space.
2617,348-4,Full aperture calibration sources of this type tend to be large and expensive.
2618,348-5,"To address these problems, a dynamic non-uniformity correction (NUC) method is proposed based on a modulated internal calibration device."
2619,348-6,"By employing the on-board calibration device to generate a dynamic scene and fully integrating the system characteristics of the scanning IRFPA into the scene-based non-uniformity correction (SBNUC) algorithm, on-orbit high dynamic range NUC is achieved without blocking the field of view."
2620,348-7,"Here we simulate an internal calibration system alternative, where a dynamic calibration signal is superimposed on the normal imagery, thus requiring no mechanisms and a smaller size."
2621,348-8,"This method using this type of calibrator shows that when the sensor is pointing at deep space for calibration, it provides an effective non-uniformity correction of the imagery."
2622,348-9,"After performing the proposed method, the NU of the two evaluation images was reduced from the initial 12.99% and 8.72% to less than 2%."
2623,348-10,"Compared to other on-board NUC methods that require an extended reference blackbody source, this proposed approach has the advantages of miniaturization, a short calibration time, and strong adaptability."
2624,349-1,"In forested areas that experience strong seasonality and are undergoing rapid land cover conversion (e.g., Brazilian savannas), the accuracy of remote sensing change detection is affected by seasonal changes that are erroneously classified as having changed."
2625,349-2,"To improve the quality and consistency of regionally important forest change maps, we aim to separate process related change (for example, spectral variability due to phenology) from changes related to deforestations or fires."
2626,349-3,"Seasonal models are typically used to account for seasonality, but fitting a model is difficult when there are insufficient data points in the time series."
2627,349-4,"In this research, we utilize remotely sensed data and related spectral trends and the spatial context at the object level to evaluate the performance of geostatistical features to reduce the impact of seasonality from the NDVI (Normalized Difference Vegetation Index) of Landsat time series."
2628,349-5,"The study area is the SAo RomAo municipality, totaling 2440 km(2), and is part of the Brazilian savannas biome."
2629,349-6,"We first create image objects via multiresolution segmentation, basing the objects on the characteristics found in the first image (2003) of the 13-year time series."
2630,349-7,"We intersected the objects with the NDVI images in order to extract semivariogram indices, the RVF (Ratio VarianceFirst lag) and AFM (Area First lagFirst Maximum), and spectral information (average and standard deviation of NDVI values) to generate the time series from these features and to derive Spatio-Temporal Metrics (change and trend) to train a Random Forest (RF) algorithm."
2631,349-8,"The NDVI spatial variability, captured by the AFM semivariogram index time series produced the best result, reaching 96.53% of the overall accuracy (OA) to separate no-change from forest change, while the greatest inter-class confusion occurred using the average of the NDVI values time series (OA = 63.72%)."
2632,349-9,The spatial context approach we presented is a novel approach for the detection of forest change events that are subject to seasonality (and possible miss-classification of change) and mitigating the effects of forest phenology without the need for specific de-seasoning models.
2633,35-1,Ground filtering is an essential procedure in almost all LiDAR applications.
2634,35-2,"However, most existing ground filtering algorithms require different amounts of user input to manually set up initial parameters, such as terrain relief amplitude and average slope, which is subjective, time consuming, and prone to errors."
2635,35-3,"Here, we propose a simple terrain relief index derived from raw airborne LiDAR data to automatically tune the slope-related parameters of ground filtering algorithms."
2636,35-4,The terrain relief index is a ratio between the height difference of the entire point cloud and the maximum above ground level of non ground points.
2637,35-5,The latter variable can be estimated with the maximum local height difference of raw LiDAR data through gridding.
2638,35-6,We validated our method using the benchmark airborne LiDAR datasets provided by the International Society for Photogrammetry and Remote Sensing.
2639,35-7,The results showed a high correlation ((r = 0.876)) between the terrain relief index and the referential terrain relief amplitude.
2640,35-8,"The degree of correlation was greater across larger areas ((r = 0.926)) than small areas ((r = 0.861)) regardless of the type of land cover ((e.g., city or forest))."
2641,35-9,"The terrain relief index was introduced into two existing filtering algorithms: Cloth Simulation Filtering (CSF) and Progressive Morphological (PM) Filter, by relating the terrain relief index to the cloth rigidness of the CSF and the slope threshold of the PM filter."
2642,35-10,"To compare the results, the two algorithms were implemented both with manually tuned parameters and with the parameters derived from the terrain relief index."
2643,35-11,"The results showed that there was only a slight discrepancy in average Total Error ((0.1%)) between them in the CSF, which means that the terrain relief index can automatically determine the cloth rigidness without noticeable loss of accuracy."
2644,35-12,"The average difference between the slope threshold provided by the terrain relief index and the manually tuned optimal slope threshold was 0.142 rad ((8.136)) for the PM filter, which is acceptable relative to manually parameter setting without any prior knowledge."
2645,35-13,"The terrain relief index can estimate the terrain relief amplitude from raw airborne LiDAR data, and the parameter settings suggested in this paper for the filtering algorithm can improve automation."
2646,350-1,The rapid and accurate estimation of wheat production at a regional scale is crucial for national food security and sustainable agricultural development.
2647,350-2,"This study developed a new gross primary productivity (GPP) estimation model (denoted as the [ACPM]), based on the effects of light, heat, soil moisture, and nitrogen content (N) on the light-use efficiency of winter wheat."
2648,350-3,"The ACPM model used the quantic additivity of the environmental factors to improve the minimum form or multiple multiplication form in the previous model and thus characterized the joint effects of heat, soil moisture, and N on crop photosynthesis performance."
2649,350-4,"The key parameters (i.e., light) were determined from the photosynthetically active radiation product of the Himawari-8 sensor and the fraction of photosynthetically active radiation product of Moderate Resolution Imaging Spectroradiometer (MODIS)."
2650,350-5,The heat was determined from the land temperature products of MODIS.
2651,350-6,"The soil moisture was obtained from the inversion using a visible and shortwave infrared drought index (VSDI), whereas the N stress of winter wheat was detected using the newly developed modified ratio vegetation index (MRVI), which could accurately obtain the spatiotemporal distribution of the leaf chlorophyll content of winter wheat."
2652,350-7,The ACPM and two other previous models (named the GPP1 and GPP2 models) were applied on the Himawari-8 and MODIS images in Hengshui City.
2653,350-8,"The evaluation results, based on the ground measurement, indicated that the ACPM models exhibited the best estimate of dry aboveground biomass (DAM) and the wheat yield in Hengshui City, with errors of <10% and <12% for the DAM and yield, respectively."
2654,350-9,"Considering the easy operation of the ACPM model and the accessibility of the corresponding satellite images, the Agriculture Crop Photosynthesis Model (ACPM) can be expected to provide information on the winter wheat shortfalls and surplus ahead of the availability of official statistical data."
2655,36-1,"When classifying point clouds, a large amount of time is devoted to the process of engineering a reliable set of features which are then passed to a classifier of choice."
2656,36-2,"Generally, such features - usually derived from the 3D-covariance matrix - are computed using the surrounding neighborhood of points."
2657,36-3,"While these features capture local information, the process is usually time-consuming and requires the application at multiple scales combined with contextual methods in order to adequately describe the diversity of objects within a scene."
2658,36-4,In this paper we present a novel 1D-fully convolutional network that consumes terrain-normalized points directly with the corresponding spectral data (if available) to generate point wise labeling while implicitly learning contextual features in an end-to-end fashion.
2659,36-5,"This unique approach allows us to operate on unordered point sets with varying densities, without relying on expensive hand-crafted features; thus reducing the time needed for testing by an order of magnitude over existing approaches."
2660,36-6,Our method uses only the 3D-coordinates and three corresponding spectral features for each point.
2661,36-7,"Spectral features may either be extracted from 2D-georeferenced images, as shown here for Light Detection and Ranging (LiDAR) point clouds, or extracted directly for passive-derived point clouds, i.e. from multiple-view imagery."
2662,36-8,We train our network by splitting the data into square regions and use a pooling layer that respects the permutation-invariance of the input points.
2663,36-9,"Evaluated using the ISPRS 3D Semantic Labeling Contest, our method scored second place with an overall accuracy of 81.6%."
2664,36-10,"We ranked third place with a mean Fl-score of 63.32%, surpassing the Fl-score of the method with highest accuracy by 1.69%."
2665,36-11,"In addition to labeling 3D-point clouds, we also show that our method can be easily extended to 2D-semantic segmentation tasks, with promising initial results."
2666,37-1,"Terrain scene category is useful not only for some geographical or environmental researches, but also for choosing suitable algorithms or proper parameters of the algorithms for several point cloud processing tasks to achieve better performance."
2667,37-2,"However, there are few studies in point cloud processing focusing on terrain scene classification at present."
2668,37-3,"In this paper, a novel deep learning framework for 3D terrain scene recognition using 2D representation of sparse point cloud is proposed."
2669,37-4,"The framework has two key components. (1) Initially, several suitable discriminative low-level local features are extracted from airborne laser scanning point cloud, and 3D terrain scene is encoded into multi-view and multimodal 2D representation. (2) A two-level fusion network embedded with feature- and decision-level fusion strategy is designed to fully exploit the 2D representation of 3D terrain scene, which can be trained end-to-end."
2670,37-5,Experiment results show that our method achieves an overall accuracy of 96.70% and a kappa coefficient of 0.96 in recognizing nine categories of terrain scene point clouds.
2671,37-6,"Extensive design choices of the underlying framework are tested, and other typical methods from literature for related research are compared."
2672,38-1,We propose a new approach for automatic refinement of unorganized point clouds captured by LiDAR scanning systems.
2673,38-2,"Given a point cloud, our method first abstracts the input data into super voxels via over segmentations, and then builds a K-nearest neighbor graph on these voxel nodes."
2674,38-3,Abstracting into voxel representation provides a means to generate an elastic wireframe over the original data.
2675,38-4,An iterative resampling method is then introduced to project resampling points to all potential surfaces considering repulsion constraints from both interior and exterior of voxels.
2676,38-5,"Our point consolidation process contributes to accurate normal estimation, uniform point distribution, and sufficient sampling density."
2677,38-6,Experiments and comparisons have demonstrated that the proposed method is effective on point clouds from a variety of datasets.
2678,39-1,"With the development of hardwares such as mobile devices and portable depth cameras, on-line 3D reconstruction on the mobile devices with depth streams as input turns to be possible and promising."
2679,39-2,Most existing systems use volumetric representation methods to fuse the depth images and use ICP algorithm to estimate the poses of cameras.
2680,39-3,"However, ICP tracker suffers from large drift in scenes containing insufficient geometric information."
2681,39-4,"To deal with this problem, we propose a stability based sampling method which select different number of point-pairs in different windows according to their geometric stability."
2682,39-5,"In addition, we fuse the ICP tracker with the IMU information through an analysis of the condition number."
2683,39-6,Then we apply the stability based sampling method to the spatially hashed volumetric representation.
2684,39-7,"Qualitative and quantitative evaluations of tracking accuracy and 3D reconstruction results show that our method outperforms the current state-of-the-art systems, especially in scenes lacking sufficient geometric information."
2685,39-8,"In total, our method achieves frame rates 20 Hz on an Apple iPad Air 2 and 200 Hz on a Nvidia GeForce GTX 1060 GPU."
2686,4-1,"The Operational Land Imager (OLI) onboard Landsat-8 satellite can provide remote sensing reflectance (R-rs) of aquatic environments with high spatial resolution (30 m), allowing for benthic habitat mapping and monitoring of bathymetry and water column optical properties."
2687,4-2,"To facilitate these applications, accurate sensor-derived R-rs is required."
2688,4-3,"In this study, we assess atmospheric correction schemes, including NASA's NIR-SWIR approach, Acolite's NIR and SWIR approaches and the cloud-shadow approach."
2689,4-4,"We provide the first comprehensive evaluation for Landsat-8 R-rs retrievals in optically shallow coral reefs, along with an investigation of Landsat-8 R-rs products in a temperate turbid embayment."
2690,4-5,The obtained Landsat-8 R-rs data products are evaluated with concurrent in situ hyperspectral R-rs measurements.
2691,4-6,Our analyses show that the NASA and the cloud-shadow approaches generated reliable R-rs products across shallow coral reefs and optically deep waters.
2692,4-7,"This evaluation suggests that high quality R-rs products are achievable from the Landsat-8 satellite in optically shallow environments, which supports further application of Landsat-8 type measurements for coral reef studies."
2693,40-1,"Point cloud segmentation groups points with similar attributes with respect to geometric, colormetric, radiometric, and/or other information to support Terrestrial Laser Scanning (TLS) data processing such as feature extraction, classification, modeling, analysis, and so forth."
2694,40-2,In this paper we propose a segmentation method consisting of two main steps.
2695,40-3,"First, a novel feature extraction approach, NORmal VAriation ANAlysis (Norvana), eliminates some noise points and extracts edge points without requiring a general (and error prone) normal estimation at each point."
2696,40-4,"Second, region growing groups the points on a smooth surface to obtain the segmentation result."
2697,40-5,"For efficiency, both steps exploit the angular grid structure storing each TLS scan that is often neglected in many segmentation algorithms, which are primarily developed for unorganized point clouds."
2698,40-6,"Additionally, unlike the existing methods exploiting the angular grid structure that can only be applied to a single scan, the proposed method is able to segment multiple registered scans simultaneously."
2699,40-7,The algorithm also takes advantage of parallel programming for efficiency.
2700,40-8,"In the experiment, both qualitative and quantitative evaluations are performed through two datasets whilst the robustness and efficiency of the proposed method are analyzed and discussed."
2701,41-1,Rail fasteners are critical components in high-speed railway.
2702,41-2,"Therefore, they are inspected periodically to ensure the safety of high-speed trains."
2703,41-3,Manual inspection and two-dimensional visual inspection are the commonly used methods.
2704,41-4,"However, both of them have drawbacks."
2705,41-5,"In this paper, a rigorous high-speed railway fastener inspection approach from structured light sensors is proposed to detect damaged and loose fasteners."
2706,41-6,"Firstly, precise and extremely dense point cloud of fasteners are obtained from commercial structured light sensors."
2707,41-7,"With a decision tree classifier, the defects of the fasteners are classified in detail."
2708,41-8,"Furthermore, a normal vector based center extraction method for complex cylindrical surface is proposed to extract the centerline of the metal clip of normal fasteners."
2709,41-9,"Lastly, the looseness of the fastener is evaluated based on the extracted centerline of the metal clip."
2710,41-10,"Experiments were conducted on high-speed railways to evaluate the accuracy, effectiveness, and the influence of the parameters of the proposed method."
2711,41-11,"The overall precision of the decision tree classifier is over 99.8% and the root-mean square error of looseness check is 0.15 mm, demonstrating a reliable and effective solution for highspeed railway fastener maintenance."
2712,42-1,Correct estimation of soil and vegetation thermal emissivities is of huge importance in remote sensing studies.
2713,42-2,It has been shown that the emissivity of leaves retrieved from field observations show subtle spectral features that are related to leaf water content.
2714,42-3,"However, such field measurements provide additional challenges before leaf water content can be successfully obtained, specifically atmospheric correction."
2715,42-4,The aim of this research was to investigate how information within hyperspectral thermal observations can be used to auto-correct the atmospheric influence.
2716,42-5,Hyperspectral thermal measurements were taken over a large variety of soil and vegetation types (including vineyard and barley) during ESA's REFLEX campaign in 2012 using a MIDAC FTIR radiometer.
2717,42-6,"Using MODTRAN simulations, a simple quadratic model was constructed that emulates the atmosphere radiative transfer between the target and the sensor."
2718,42-7,"Afterwards, this model was used to estimate the concentrations of H2O (g) and CO2 (g) while simultaneously correcting for these gas absorptions."
2719,42-8,"Finally, a temperature-emissivity separation was applied to estimate the emissivities of the different land surface components."
2720,43-1,Total phosphorus (TP) is an important factor of eutrophication.
2721,43-2,The accurate monitoring of TP concentration is conducive to the management of water environments.
2722,43-3,"To improve the accuracy of TP remote sensing inversion, this paper improved and studied the following three aspects."
2723,43-4,"First, a new optical classification method was constructed to classify water into two different types."
2724,43-5,"Compared with other classification methods, the proposed method can be more effective for improving the accuracy of TP inversion."
2725,43-6,"Second, data regression analysis and fitting (DRF), back propagation neural network (BP) and random forest (RF) were used to build TP inversion models based on the different water type."
2726,43-7,"The validation results indicated that the DRF performed best, with the highest precision for all water types, and was suitable for TP inversion."
2727,43-8,"Finally, the performance of the classification and inversion algorithms on Sentinel-3 data was evaluated and one image was acquired for mapping the TP concentration in Taihu Lake."
2728,43-9,"All in all, this study improves the accuracy of TP inversion by combining the new classification algorithm with DRF."
2729,43-10,"This is significant for the development of class-based water quality parameter inversion algorithms for water color remote sensing, and this approach can be applied in the effective management and control of the eutrophication of lake environments."
2730,44-1,High spatial resolution hyperspectral imagery has shown considerable potential for deriving accurate land cover maps in urban areas.
2731,44-2,"In this paper, a new classification framework for mapping land cover in urban environments using high spatial resolution hyperspectral data was proposed."
2732,44-3,"The proposed classification scheme was applied to map urban land cover using APEX data in the city of Baden, Switzerland."
2733,44-4,"We first used the NDWI and NDVI indices to separate the land cover in the scene into three main classes: water, vegetation and non-vegetated surface."
2734,44-5,Then we partitioned the scene into many superpixels and applied classification using a SVM separately on the vegetation and non-vegetated surfaces.
2735,44-6,"Soil was classified both in vegetation and non-vegetated surface, and these two soil results were merged in the final classification map."
2736,44-7,"Shadows were initially classified in shaded vegetation surfaces and shaded non-vegetated surfaces, and then they were further classified into meaningful land cover categories."
2737,44-8,Our experimental results demonstrate that the proposed classification framework is well suited for mapping land cover in urban environments using high resolution hyperspectral data.
2738,44-9,"Although the proposed method performs better than traditional methods in terms of soil classification accuracy, our findings emphasize that the soil class should be interpreted with caution in urban land cover maps derived from remote sensing data, even when high spatial resolution hyperspectral data are used."
2739,44-10,"Results from this study also demonstrate that although shaded surfaces are generally classified as a single category in urban environments, in high resolution hyperspectral data, the shadows can be further classified into meaningful land cover classes with an acceptable accuracy."
2740,45-1,"Urban planning to solve environmental problems in Latin American cities requires information that commonly does not exist or, if it does exist, is at different scales, which makes the information incomparable."
2741,45-2,"Therefore, a quantitative approach is proposed to assess an urban environmental quality index (UEQI) for Cali, Colombia, integrating remote sensing and census data."
2742,45-3,"Landsat TM images were used to extract biophysical indicators: land surface temperature (LST), normalized difference vegetation index (NDVI), soil adjusted vegetation index (SAVI), leaf wetness content index (LWCI), normalized humid index (NHI), normalized difference built-up index (NDBI), and normalized difference impervious surface index (NDISI)."
2743,45-4,These seven indicators were integrated with seven socioeconomic indicators obtained from census data using multivariate statistical analysis to determine the UEQ index at the commune level.
2744,45-5,"The results showed consistent correlation among the indicators, and the highest values of UEQI occurred in communes with less built-up areas and more green areas."
2745,45-6,There were statistically significant differences among the index at the commune level.
2746,45-7,"Therefore, communes were categorized into five classes (very good, good, moderate, poor and very poor environmental quality) according to the index to determine the most critical interventions to be made by planning and decision-making institutions."
2747,45-8,This method could be applied to similar cities using large-scale administrative units.
2748,46-1,"The Moderate-resolution Wide-wavelengths Imager (MWI) is the next-generation ocean-color sensor independently designed by China and was successfully launched on September 15, 2016 onboard the Tiangong-2 (TG-2) Space Lab."
2749,46-2,It is currently urgent to assess the capability and data quality of the MWI sensor to determine its future applications.
2750,46-3,"In this study, we first assessed the signal-to-noise ratio (SNR) and the radiometric sensitivity of the MWI."
2751,46-4,"With this goal, we chose the third largest freshwater lake in China, Lake Taihu, as our test area and assessed the capability of the MWI to monitor the turbid inland waters by comparing its consistency with that of Moderate Resolution Imaging Spectroradiometer (MODIS) data and Geostationary Ocean Color Imager (GOCI) data."
2752,46-5,"Our results show that (1) the SNR values of the MWI are greater than 400 in the visible band and are sufficient to effectively avoid ocean-color data errors caused by the sensor noise; however, the SNR values of the MWI are below 200 in the near-infrared (NIR) band and are lower than the theoretical expectation for the design of ocean-color sensors; (2) on the one hand, the MWI-derived remote sensing reflectance (R-rs)data have large errors in the blue band ((R-2 < 0.20, MAPE < 50%)) but reduced errors in the red and NIR bands with a high correlation (R-2 > (190, MAPE < 10%) compared with in situ R-rs; on the other hand, the MWI-derived R-rs data are generally consistent with the MODIS- and GOCI-derived R-rs data (((R-2 > 0.90, MAPE < 10%))); and (3) the MWI-derived concentration distributions of cyanobacterial algal blooms and suspended particulate matter (SPM) in Lake Taihu exhibit high spatial resolutions and good accuracies and are in good agreement with the corresponding distributions yielded by the MODIS and GOCI satellites (((R-2 > 0.90, MAPE < 10%)))."
2753,46-6,"However, the MWI cannot detect signals at the important 700-710 bands and consequently has a relatively weak capability to detect chlorophyll-a (Chia) concentrations in inland waters."
2754,46-7,"In summary, as the Chinese next-generation ocean-color sensor, the overall performance metrics of the MWI approach the present international level."
2755,46-8,"Meanwhile, we suggest that the band of the MWI can be further optimized to improve the derived SNR values in the near-infrared band in order to satisfy the requirements of satellite observations over inland waters."
2756,47-1,"Since 2007, green tides caused by massive blooms of Enteromorpha prolifera have occurred in the Yellow Sea during April and September every year."
2757,47-2,"Generally, the macroalgae first gathered around the Jiangsu coastline and then moved northeastward toward the Shandong Peninsula, but the paths and distribution of green tides have featured obvious inter-annual variation."
2758,47-3,"Here, we describe a new method to forecasting the drift path of green tides with some climate indices such as Nino3.4."
2759,47-4,This method may help policy makers to develop a strategy to prevent green tide disasters and mitigate the consequence more effectively.
2760,48-1,"The LiDAR-derived Canopy height model (CHM), due to its wide applications in forestry, is important for foresters."
2761,48-2,"Before a CHM can be considered a valuable, objective source of information about a canopy surface, it must be properly interpolated and preprocessed, which may sometimes be challenging, especially in case of multilayer and multispecies forest."
2762,49-1,"This study evaluated the potential of five seasonal high resolution Pleiades satellite images for improving urban tree species classification in the City of Tampa, FL, USA."
2763,49-2,We assessed and compared the capabilities of individual and combined Pleiades images acquired during different seasons for classifying the urban tree species to understand the seasonal effect on tree species mapping accuracy.
2764,49-3,"The seven species and groups included sand live oak (Quercus geminata), laurel oak ((Q. laurifolia)), live oak ((Q. virginiana)), pine (species group), palm (species group), camphor (Cinnamomum camphora), and magnolia (Magnolia grandifiora)."
2765,49-4,A multi-level classification system was adopted to classify image objects of the tree species and groups.
2766,49-5,"Species classification performance was compared between the five individual seasonal Pleiades images, between two combined dry-wet season images, and between the optimal single season and combined dry-wet season image data."
2767,49-6,Shade image objects were spectrally normalized to similar sunlit image objects.
2768,49-7,The tree species fraction features were extracted from the seasonal images using the Mixture Tuned Matching Filtering approach and used as additional features to a set of spectral and spatial/textural features.
2769,49-8,"Random Forest, Support Vector Machine and Linear Discriminant Analysis classifiers were used to classify the seven tree species and groups with image objects features."
2770,49-9,"The experimental results indicate significantly improved tree species mapping accuracies using late spring season (April) image compared to all other seasonal images ((p < 0.01)), and combined dry-wet season images performed even better."
2771,49-10,Results suggest a significant seasonal effect on tree species classification.
2772,49-11,The results also demonstrate that the Random Forest outperformed the Support Vector Machine and Linear Discriminant Analysis classifiers for tree species classification.
2773,49-12,"Therefore, in practice, it is important to choose appropriate seasonal remote sensing data for mapping tree species."
2774,5-1,"The L-band (1.41 GHz) passive microwave remote sensing technique is the approach used by the first satellites dedicated to soil moisture measurement, the European Space Agency's (ESA) Soil Moisture and Ocean Salinity (SMOS), and the Soil Moisture Active Passive (SMAP) mission developed by the National Aeronautics and Space Administration (NASA)."
2775,5-2,These satellites aim to provide global soil moisture maps for the top similar to 5 cm layer of soil with an accuracy better than 0.04 m(3)/m(3).
2776,5-3,"However, with a passive microwave observing resolution of similar to 40 km, non-soil targets such as surface rock may possibly confound the brightness temperature observations and degrade the accuracy of retrievals for many SMOS and SMAP pixels across the world."
2777,5-4,"Since the microwave contribution of rock is not well accounted for in current soil moisture retrieval algorithms, simply ignoring its existence may be detrimental to the performance of resultant soil moisture products."
2778,5-5,"Using a combination of model simulations and airborne field campaign data from central Australia, this study has determined that a rock cover fraction threshold of up to 0.4 can be tolerated before the 0.04 m(3)/m(3) soil moisture target accuracy is potentially exceeded under extreme dry or wet conditions."
2779,5-6,"However, this threshold reduces to 0.2 when assessed in terms of a brightness temperature impact > 4 K."
2780,5-7,"These rock fraction thresholds have subsequently been applied to the Ecoclimap rock cover map, identifying the SMOS and SMAP pixels globally that are likely to be adversely affected if rock is unaccounted for."
2781,5-8,"The results show that approximately similar to 3.3% of all SMOS and SMAP pixels may have brightness temperature impacts exceeding 4 K from surface rock, with Asia being the most affected, having similar to 6.0% affected pixels."
2782,5-9,"These values reduce to similar to 1.5% of SMOS and SMAP pixels globally, and similar to 3.1% for Asia, when assessed in terms of soil moisture errors expected to possibly exceed 0.04 m(3)/m(3) when not accounting for surface rock."
2783,50-1,Percent vegetation cover (PVC) and the fraction of absorbed photosynthetically active radiation (fAPAR) are important functional variables for assessing Arctic vegetation density and vigor.
2784,50-2,"In this study, field measures of PVC, fAPAR and normalized difference vegetation index (NDVI) were collected from July 5 to August 8, 2015 ((i.e., summer season)) along a moisture gradient in the Apex River Watershed (ARW) (63 degrees 45'N, 68 degrees 30'W), Baffin Island, Nunavut, Canada."
2785,50-3,"Two field methods for estimating PVC ((i.e., the point-frame and image classification methods)) were examined and it was determined that the image classification approach provided a suitable alternative to the point-frame method, especially for detecting changes in Arctic PVC."
2786,50-4,"Meanwhile, fAPAR was measured based on the method presented by Tagesson et al. (2012): f APAR = (1 -PAR(Reflected)/PAR(incoming)) x PVC."
2787,50-5,The spatial and temporal patterns of PVC and fAPAR in the context of NDVI derived from remote sensing data were examined.
2788,50-6,"For this site, vegetation types exhibited contrasting patterns of PVC as a result of differing moisture regimes: (1) vegetation types with saturated soils ((e.g., sedge dominated)) exhibited a continuous increase in PVC throughout the growing season; (2) mesic vegetation types with moderate soil moisture ((e.g., mosses dominated with a mixture of sedges and shrubs)) exhibited an increase in PVC from July to early August followed by a decline in mid-August; and (3) semi-desert vegetation types that tended to dry early in the growing season ((e.g., dominated by prostrate dwarf shrubs, herb tundra and large areas of bare soil and rock)) exhibited little variation in PVC."
2789,50-7,"Field measures of PVC and fAPAR demonstrated strong relationships to field NDVI data and the vegetation indices (VIs) derived from 2 m-resolution WorldView-2 data, thereby providing further evidence that VIs are well-suited for modelling PVC and fAPAR of Arctic vegetation."
2790,51-1,Global-scale surface soil moisture products are currently available from multiple remote sensing platforms.
2791,51-2,Footprint-scale assessments of these products are generally restricted to limited number of densely-instrumented validation sites.
2792,51-3,"However, by taking active and passive soil moisture products together with a third independent soil moisture estimates via land surface modeling, triple collocation (TC) can be applied to estimate the correlation metric of satellite soil moisture products (versus an unknown ground truth) over a quasi-global domain."
2793,51-4,"Here, an assessment of Soil Moisture Active Passive (SMAP), Soil Moisture Ocean Salinity (SMOS) and Advanced SCATterometer (ASCAT) surface soil moisture retrievals via TC is presented."
2794,51-5,"Considering the potential violation of TC error assumptions, the impact of active-passive and satellite-model error cross correlations on the TC-derived inter-comparison results is examined at in situ sites using quadruple collocation analysis."
2795,51-6,"In addition, confidence intervals for the TC-estimated correlation metric are constructed from moving-block bootstrap sampling designed to preserve the temporal persistence of the original (unevenly-sampled) soil moisture time series."
2796,51-7,"This study is the first to apply TC to obtain a robust global-scale cross-assessment of SMAP, SMOS and ASCAT soil moisture retrieval accuracy in terms of anomaly temporal correlation."
2797,51-8,"Our results confirm the overall advantage of SMAP ((with a global average anomaly correlation of 0.76)) over SMOS ((0.66)) and ASCAT ((0.63)) that has been established in several recent regional, ground-based studies."
2798,51-9,"SMAP is also the best-performing product over the majority of applicable land pixels (52%), although SMOS and ASCAT each shows advantage in distinct geographic regions."
2799,52-1,The availability of remote sensing images of various resolutions has enabled the incorporation of landscape structures in land-cover mapping.
2800,52-2,"Despite the effectiveness of landscape metrics in quantifying landscape structures, they are inadequate in characterizing three elements: spatial neighborhoods, spatial dependencies, and semantic dependencies."
2801,52-3,"Moreover, methods for mining the regularity of landscape-structure heterogeneity ((i.e., spatial variations in landscape structures)) are still limited, particularly for applications in urban land-cover mapping."
2802,52-4,This study hence proposes a novel approach with the aims to (1) characterize landscape structures considering the above three elements; (2) mine the regularity of landscape-structure heterogeneity; and (3) apply landscape-structure information as contexts to improve urban land-cover mapping.
2803,52-5,"To achieve the first aim, landscape-structure features including pair-wise spatial relationships and neighborhood-based landscape metrics are defined."
2804,52-6,"To accomplish the second aim, a clustering technique and a landscape infographic are used to cluster landscape structures and visualize landscape-structure types, respectively."
2805,52-7,"Finally, a hierarchical classifier based on the feedforward multi-layer perceptron is developed for the third aim."
2806,52-8,"Experiments are conducted in a heterogeneous urban environment in Beijing, China."
2807,52-9,"The results show that the proposed approach, which considers 34 landscape-structure features and 19 landscape-structure types, achieves a classification accuracy improvement of 6.43% compared with the approaches without considering landscape-structure information."
2808,52-10,This study therefore demonstrates the effectiveness of incorporating landscape-structure features and landscape-structure types in improving urban land-cover mapping.
2809,53-1,Characterizing offshore areas for marine conservation faces impediment from logistics and costs of in situ data collection.
2810,53-2,"This study leveraged the high spatial and temporal coverage provided by remote-sensing ocean colour products, and the concept of biogeographical classification to delineate areas in the pelagic environment with application to marine conservation."
2811,53-3,"Satellite-derived and modelled biogeophysical data were used to delineate an area of biological and physical homogeneity spatially consistent with the static boundaries of the Scotian Slope Ecologically and Biologically Significant Area (EBSA), off eastern Canada."
2812,53-4,"We used iterative cluster analysis applied to an archive (2004-2014) that consisted of remotely-sensed Chlorophyll a, sea-surface temperature, and primary production derived from the Moderate resolution Imaging Spectroradiometer (MODIS), and simulated mixed layer depth to define ""dynamic"" boundaries of the EBSA at bi-weekly, seasonal and annual resolutions."
2813,53-5,"The final cluster extended further east than the static EBSA in summer and fall, indicating that characteristics of the static EBSA environment persist beyond the current boundaries in these seasons."
2814,53-6,"In winter and spring, the final areas derived by our analysis was smaller than the static EBSA, but again showed extension beyond the current eastern boundary."
2815,53-7,Both ice and cloud cover affecting remotely-sensed data and the extent of water column mixing were important in determining the size of the final cluster.
2816,53-8,"The dynamic cluster east of the original static boundary incorporated an area of lower Chlorophyll a and water column primary production in the spring, but higher values in the autumn relative to the static area."
2817,53-9,Overall physical and biological characteristics of the static and dynamic EBSA considered in this research were similar within and across years.
2818,53-10,This methodology incorporates ocean-colour data and modelled estimates of multiple biological and physical characteristics to objectively refine areas of ecological interest at a spatial scale relevant for the management of marine conservation areas.
2819,54-1,Urban land-use mapping is a significant yet challenging task in the field of remote sensing.
2820,54-2,"Although numerous classification methods have been developed for obtaining land-use information in urban areas, the accuracy and efficiency of these methods are insufficient to meet the requirements of real-world applications such as urban planning and land management."
2821,54-3,"In recent years, deep learning techniques, especially deep convolutional neural networks (DCNN), have achieved an astonishing level of performance in image classification."
2822,54-4,"However, the traditional DCNN methods do not focus on multispectral remote sensing images with more than three channels, and they are limited by their training samples."
2823,54-5,"In addition, these methods uniformly decompose large images into small processing units, which chop up the land-use patterns and produce land-use maps with obvious ""blocks""."
2824,54-6,"In this study, a semi-transfer deep convolutional neural network (STDCNN) approach is proposed to overcome these weaknesses."
2825,54-7,The proposed STDCNN has three parts: one part involves a transferred DCNN with deep architecture; another part is designed to analyze multispectral images; and the final part fuses the first two parts into a classification layer.
2826,54-8,"Moreover, a skeleton-based decomposing method using street block data is devised to maintain the integrity of the land-use patterns."
2827,54-9,"In two case studies, the proposed method is used to generate urban land-use maps from a WorldView-3 image of a 143 km(2) area of Hong Kong and a WorldView-2 image of a 25 km(2) area of Shenzhen."
2828,54-10,"The results show that the proposed STDCNN obtains an overall accuracy (OA) of 91.25% and a Kappa coefficient (Kappa) of 0.903 for Hong Kong land-use classification, and an OA of 80% and a Kappa of 0.780 for Shenzhen land-use classification."
2829,54-11,"In addition, due to the proposed skeleton-based decomposition method, the proposed method can produce better land-use maps for real-world urban applications."
2830,55-1,The potential for estimating streamflow in large continental rivers from satellite observations of river hydraulic variables has been well recognized.
2831,55-2,However this has not been widely applied to smaller regional rivers.
2832,55-3,"In this study, we investigated the reliability of calibrating a hydrological model for the upper Yalongjiang River Basin on the Qinghai-Tibet Plateau, based solely on river water surface widths derived from four high spatial resolution commercial satellite images: two from QuickBird and one each from IKONOS and WorldView-1."
2833,55-4,The model was forced using satellite-based meteorological datasets and calibrated using remotely sensed river widths.
2834,55-5,"In situ gauged data are not used for modeling, making the approach applicable for ungauged basins."
2835,55-6,"To shift the calibration objective from streamflow to river width, the hydrological model is connected to the at-a station hydraulic geometry (AHG) relationship."
2836,55-7,Generalized likelihood uncertainty estimation was used for automatic calibration and to better quantify simulation uncertainty.
2837,55-8,"After constraining the model parameter space solely to the river width observations, the Nash-Sutcliffe Efficiency values for the streamflow simulated using the calibrated model reached 64.3% in the calibration period and 55.8% in the validation period."
2838,55-9,"When calibrating the model using river width datasets with designed measurement error associated with riparian canopy, the influences of error on model simulation were less than expected."
2839,55-10,This was because the effect of the error was counteracted by adjustment of the AHG parameters.
2840,55-11,"Both superimposing updated ranges for the AHG parameters and further constraining the model output using hydrological signature information following calibration reduced simulation uncertainty, particularly with use of the latter method."
2841,55-12,"This study demonstrates the potential for application of the proposed calibration method to regional ungauged basins lacking ground streamflow observation data, and provides insights into how remote sensing data can be more effectively integrated with hydrological modeling."
2842,56-1,"Mexico's largest freshwater body, Lake Chapala, is the main source of drinking water for over 4-million inhabitants."
2843,56-2,"This study used satellite and field data to obtain annual estimates of Lake Chapala's area and water volume from 1973 to 2009, as well as water intakes from 1934 to 2013."
2844,56-3,"Twenty-one Landsat images (multispectral scanner system, 2, 5, and 7) for the period of 1973 to 2009 were processed."
2845,56-4,Gap filling correction was applied to Landsat 7 enhanced thematic mapper plus scan line corrector-off images.
2846,56-5,Binary water/no-water segmentation was obtained with a Markov random field model using the normalized difference water index.
2847,56-6,"An area-based model was developed to calculate water volume, which used the lake's area estimated based on the images as well as an exponential function obtained from area-elevation curves."
2848,56-7,Three of the resulting water/no-water layers were validated against reference points taken from aerial photography.
2849,56-8,Overall accuracies of 77% to 90% were obtained.
2850,56-9,A correlation coefficient of 0.9 resulted when comparing the results from using remote sensing to calculate water volume against field measurements.
2851,56-10,"Given the observed reduction in volume, we concluded that it will be difficult to continue to use the lake as the main source of freshwater for the Guadalajara metropolitan area without substantial interventions."
2852,57-1,"The regional surface soil heat flux (G(0)) is very important for the large-scale land surface process modeling, and particularly for the regional evapotranspiration estimation."
2853,57-2,Harmonic analysis method (HM) could obtain regional G(0) using remote sensing data.
2854,57-3,"However, it has been demonstrated that HM cannot work well during nighttime due to the nonharmonic nature of G(0)."
2855,57-4,"Encouraged by the half-order method (HO), which can resolve nonharmonic series, this study combined the two methods of HM and HO in order to obtain an accurate estimation of G(0) for full day."
2856,57-5,The combined method was assessed with in-situ measurements and was applied to the Heihe River Basin (HRB) of northwest China using multiremote sensing observations at 30-min intervals.
2857,57-6,"The below-canopy soil surface temperature (T-s) is one of the key variables in the model, which can be estimated from canopy temperature (T-e)."
2858,57-7,The relationship of T-e and T-s was discussed.
2859,57-8,"Results show that the nighttime G(0) improves with coefficient of determination (R-2) from 0.17 to 0.66 by HO method over maize and from 0.09 to 0.81 over grassland, and root mean square error decreases from 24.5 to 16.6 W m(-2), 16.1 to 8.68 W m(-2) over maize and grassland, respectively."
2860,57-9,"Regional G(0) for bare soil is larger than the vegetation surface, and values in the middle reach area of HRB are generally higher than the upper reach area because of larger fractional vegetation cover in the upper reach."
2861,57-10,"For maize, grassland, and vegetable surfaces (all are dense vegetation in July in this study), the combined method performed better when using T-e (almost coincides with remote sensing measurement land surface temperature) than estimated T-s by a simple empirical formula provided by Murray and Verhoef."
2862,57-11,The combined method gets more accurate diurnal G(0) than individual HM.
2863,57-12,"However, a more theoretical relationship of T-e and T-s is required when more accurate G(0) is needed in other studies."
2864,58-1,Ship classification in synthetic aperture radar (SAR) images is essential in remote sensing but still full of challenges in the deep learning era.
2865,58-2,The unbalanced dataset and lack of models are two limitations.
2866,58-3,Upsampling with data augmentation and ratio batching are proposed to solve the first problem.
2867,58-4,Upsampling with data augmentation is upsampling by cropping and flipping.
2868,58-5,It can improve the diversity of the dataset.
2869,58-6,Ratio batching is realized by choosing the same amount of ships per class in each minibatch.
2870,58-7,It can make the model converge faster and better.
2871,58-8,"To solve the second problem, a new loss function and convolutional neural network model are proposed."
2872,58-9,The new loss function can maximize the intraclass compactness and interclass separation simultaneously.
2873,58-10,Dense residual network has two submodules.
2874,58-11,One is the identity mapping through elementwise summation to reuse old features.
2875,58-12,The other is dense connection through concatenation to exploit new features.
2876,58-13,The designed architecture is suitable for the task of SAR ship classification.
2877,58-14,We use the confusion matrix and accuracy averaged on classes to measure the performance.
2878,58-15,"From the experiments, we can find that the proposed ideas have excellent performance especially on the rare classes."
2879,59-1,"This study proposed a green-red band quasianalytical algorithm, QAA-GRI, and evaluates its performance using an in situ dataset from Lake Qiandaohu, a drinking water source, in China."
2880,59-2,"First, by shifting the reference wavelength from 555 to 510 nm, a green-red index (GRI) can be calculated from remote sensing reflectance at 510, 560, and 620 nm, and the index was then used to retrieve the total absorption coefficients at the reference band, a(510)."
2881,59-3,"Second, a semianalytical model based on a (510) and the GRI was deduced to establish the QAA-GRI, replacing the empirical model in quasianalytical algorithm version 5 (QAA-v5)."
2882,59-4,"The QAA-GRI was applied to retrieve absorption coefficients from an in situ dataset of Lake Qiandaohu, and the QAA-GRI's performance was compared with that of QAA-v5 and another red-green QAA-based approach (QAA-RGR)."
2883,59-5,"The results demonstrate that, for this dataset, the QAA-GRI exhibited better performance ((R-2 = 0.81, mean absolute percentage error, MAPE = 15.7%)), which indicated a clear improvement in the accuracy of absorption coefficient retrieval, compared with QAA-v5 ((R-2 = 0.56, MAPE = 21.2%)) and QAA-RGR ((R-2 = 0.67, MAPE = 22.6%))."
2884,59-6,"In addition, to illustrate the QAA-GRI's assumptions and its applicability, the QAA-GRI was also applied to an in situ dataset from Taihu Lake, a highly turbid and eutrophic water source."
2885,59-7,"As predicted, when applied to Taihu Lake, the QAA-GRI did not perform as well as it did when applied to Lake Qiandaohu because of the former's extremely high turbidity, which can cause greater uncertainty with regard to backscattering coefficients."
2886,59-8,This study suggests that the QAA-GRI is better suited to the retrieval of absorption coefficients from drinking water resources.
2887,59-9,Our algorithm will also have potential applications to satellite data from the Medium Resolution Imaging Spectrometer or Ocean and Land Color Instrument.
2888,6-1,We developed an approach to estimate snow water equivalent (SWE) through interpolation of spatially representative point measurements using a k-nearest neighbors (k-NN) algorithm and historical spatial SWE data.
2889,6-2,"It accurately reproduced measured SWE, using different data sources for training and evaluation."
2890,6-3,"In the central-Sierra American River basin, we used a k-NN algorithm to interpolate data from continuous snow-depth measurements in 10 sensor clusters by fusing them with 14 years of daily 500-m resolution SWE-reconstruction maps."
2891,6-4,"Accurate SWE estimation over the melt season shows the potential for providing daily, near real-time distributed snowmelt estimates."
2892,6-5,"Further south, in the Merced-Tuolumne basins, we evaluated the potential of k-NN approach to improve real-time SWE estimates."
2893,6-6,"Lacking dense ground-measurement networks, we simulated k-NN interpolation of sensor data using selected pixels of a bi-weekly Lidar-derived snow water equivalent product. k-NN extrapolations underestimate the Lidar-derived SWE, with a maximum bias of -10 cm at elevations below 3000 m and +15 cm above 3000 m."
2894,6-7,This bias was reduced by using a Gaussian-process regression model to spatially distribute residuals.
2895,6-8,"Using as few as 10 scenes of Lidar-derived SWE from 2014 as training data in the k-NN to estimate the 2016 spatial SWE, both RMSEs and MAEs were reduced from around 20-25 cm to 10-15 cm comparing to using SWE reconstructions as training data."
2896,6-9,We found that the spatial accuracy of the historical data is more important for learning the spatial distribution of SWE than the number of historical scenes available.
2897,6-10,Blending continuous spatially representative ground-based sensors with a historical library of SWE reconstructions over the same basin can provide real-time spatial SWE maps that accurately represents Lidar-measured snow depth; and the estimates can be improved by using historical Lidar scans instead of SWE reconstructions.
2898,60-1,Convolutional neural network (CNN) models achieve state-of-the-art performance for natural image semantic segmentation.
2899,60-2,An approach for extracting vegetation from Gaofen-2 (GF-2) remote sensing imagery based on the CNN model is presented.
2900,60-3,We constructed a convolutional encoder neural networks (CENN) consisting of two layers.
2901,60-4,"The first layer has two sets of convolutional kernels for extracting the features of farmland and woodland, respectively."
2902,60-5,The second layer consists of two encoders that use nonlinear functions to encode the learned features and map the encoding results to the corresponding category number.
2903,60-6,"In the training stage, samples of farmland, woodland, and other lands are categorically used to train the CENN."
2904,60-7,"After training is accomplished, the CENN would acquire enough ability to accurately extract farmland and woodland from GF-2 imagery."
2905,60-8,The CENN was trained on 36 GF-2 images and tested on three other GF-2 images.
2906,60-9,"We compared the proposed method to a deep belief network, a fully convolutional network, and a DeepLab model using the same images."
2907,60-10,The experiments demonstrate that the proposed approach improves upon the accuracy of existing approaches.
2908,60-11,"The average precision, recall, and kappa coefficient of the proposed approach were 0.91, 0.87, and 0.86, respectively."
2909,60-12,"Thus, the proposed approach is proven to effectively extract vegetation from GF-2 imagery."
2910,61-1,Actual evapotranspiration is one of the most important component for efficient water management and planning.
2911,61-2,"Until recently, evapotranspiration computations and measurements have been performed locally."
2912,61-3,"But, in recent years, actual evapotranspiration computations can be calculated regionally thanks to improvements on remote sensing discipline and satellites."
2913,61-4,Surface Energy Balance Algorithm for Land (SEBAL) is one of the most commonly preferred technics for actual evapotranspiration mapping.
2914,61-5,"However, this algorithm has some difficulties such as mismatch with Landsat 8 and hot-wet pixel selection which require expert knowledge."
2915,61-6,"In this paper, a novel SEBAL based approach (SEBAL-BSA), which can use Landsat 8 images as data and can automatically perform hot-wet pixel selection using Backtracking Search Algorithm (BSA) with ground control points, has been proposed."
2916,61-7,"SEBAL-BSA was developed and tested using January 22-2015, April 28-2015 and July 01-2015 dated Landsat 8 images in Akarsu Irrigation Water User Association command area in the cukurova Region of Turkey and actual evapotranspiration mapping was realized without albedo measurements."
2917,61-8,Accuracy of SEBAL-BSA has been examined by comparing values of predefined ground truth points and values obtained from proposed approach.
2918,61-9,"According to results of parametric matched pairs T test and nonparametric Wilcoxon sign rank test, SEBAL-BSA is highly successful."
2919,61-10,Applications also show that the SEBAL-BSA is a user-friendly approach for institutions and organizations related to water authorization and management.
2920,62-1,One of the main problems of optical remote sensing is clouds and cloud shadows caused by specific atmospheric conditions during data acquisition.
2921,62-2,"These features limit the usage of acquired images and increase the difficulty in data analysis, such as normalized difference vegetation index values, misclassification, and atmospheric correction."
2922,62-3,Accurate detection and reliable cloning of cloud and cloud shadow features in satellite images are very useful processes for optical remote sensing applications.
2923,62-4,"In this study, an automated cloud removal algorithm to generate cloud and cloud shadow free images from multitemporal Landsat-8 images is introduced."
2924,62-5,Cloud and cloud shadow areas are classified by using process-based rule set developed by using spectral and spatial features after applying simple linear iterative clustering superpixel segmentation algorithm to the image to find cloud pixel groups easily and correctly.
2925,62-6,Segmentation-based cloud detection method gives better results than pixel-based for detection of cloud and cloud shadow patches.
2926,62-7,"After detection of clouds and cloud shadows, cloud-free images are created by cloning cloudless regions from multitemporal dataset."
2927,62-8,Spectral and structural consistency are preserved by considering spectral features and seasonal effects while cloning process.
2928,62-9,Statistical similarity tests are applied to find best cloud-free image to use for cloning process.
2929,62-10,Cloning results are tested with the structural similarity index metric to evaluate the performance of cloning algorithm.
2930,63-1,"Perforation, dissection, fragmentation, shrinkage and attrition in ecosystems take place due to urbanization."
2931,63-2,"In this study, where and when temporal and spatial heterogeneity occurs is tried to be explained by taking human intervention in landscape pattern and processes in and around the city of Denizli into account and how this heterogeneity affects habitat conditions within the scope of landscape ecology."
2932,63-3,Landscape pattern metrics were estimated in order to reveal the change in habitats and present the properties of the landscape.
2933,63-4,"30 pattern indicators on class and pattern levels, which are important to show human-environment interaction, were analyzed in order to indicate the features of the landscape such as area, side, shape and dispersion."
2934,63-5,"To this end, LANDSAT TM/7-ETM/8-OLI satellite images of 1987 and 2013 were classified for laying the foundations of the analysis."
2935,63-6,"Analyses showed that between 1987 and 2013, complicated shape features, increase in edge habitats, de-growth in core areas and eventually fragmentation in landscape have been dominant."
2936,63-7,Heterogenic structure in landscape has increased.
2937,63-8,"This points not to the self-functioning of the landscape, but to the domination of human intervention over the landscape."
2938,63-9,"Particularly, due to urban growth and sprawl, fragmentation, isolation and habitat loss in croplands have increased."
2939,63-10,"This study sets forth the usefulness of remote sensing, GIS and landscape metrics in understanding how urban dynamics and ecosystems change in developing urban politics."
2940,64-1,High-resolution drone aerial surveys combined with object-based image analysis are transforming our capacity to monitor and manage aquatic vegetation in an era of invasive species.
2941,64-2,"To better exploit the potential of these technologies, there is a need to develop more efficient and accessible analysis workflows and focus more efforts on the distinct challenge of mapping submerged vegetation."
2942,64-3,"We present a straightforward workflow developed to monitor emergent and submerged invasive water soldier (Stratiotes abides) in shallow waters of the Trent-Severn Waterway in Ontario, Canada."
2943,64-4,The main elements of the workflow are: (1) collection of radiometrically calibrated multispectral imagery including a near-infrared band; (2) multistage segmentation of the imagery involving an initial separation of above-water from submerged features; and (3) automated classification of features with a supervised machine-learning classifier.
2944,64-5,The approach yielded excellent classification accuracy for emergent features (overall accuracy = 92%; kappa = 88%; water soldier producer's accuracy = 92%; user's accuracy = 91%) and good accuracy for submerged features (overall accuracy = 84%; kappa = 75%; water soldier producer's accuracy = 71%; user's accuracy = 84%).
2945,64-6,"The workflow employs off-the-shelf graphical software tools requiring no programming or coding, and could therefore be used by anyone with basic GIS and image analysis skills for a potentially wide variety of aquatic vegetation monitoring operations."
2946,65-1,Approximately 1000 Canadian Hydrographic Service (CHS) charts cover Canada's oceans and navigable waters.
2947,65-2,Many charts use information collected with techniques that predate the more advanced technologies available to Hydrographic Offices (HOs) today.
2948,65-3,"Furthermore, gaps in survey data, particularly in the Canadian Arctic where only 6% of waters are surveyed to modern standards, are also problematic."
2949,65-4,"Through a Canadian Space Agency (CSA) Government Related Initiatives Program (GRIP) project, CHS is exploring remote sensing techniques to assist with the improvement of Canadian navigational charts."
2950,65-5,"Projects exploring optical/Synthetic Aperture Radar (SAR) shoreline extraction and change detection, as well as optical Satellite-Derived Bathymetry (SDB), are currently underway."
2951,65-6,"This paper focuses on SDB extracted from high-resolution optical imagery, highlighting current results as well as the challenges and opportunities CHS will encounter when implementing SDB within its operational chart production process."
2952,65-7,SDB is of particular interest to CHS due to its ability to supplement depths derived from traditional hydrographic surveys.
2953,65-8,"This is of great importance in shallow and/or remote Canadian waters where achieving wide-area depth coverage through traditional surveys is costly, time-consuming and a safety risk to survey operators."
2954,65-9,"With an accuracy of around 1 m, SDB could be used by CHS to fill gaps in survey data and to provide valuable information in dynamic areas."
2955,66-1,This paper focuses on the use of ultra-high resolution Unmanned Aircraft Systems (UAS) imagery to classify tree species.
2956,66-2,Multispectral surveys were performed on a plant nursery to produce Digital Surface Models and orthophotos with ground sample distance equal to 0.01 m.
2957,66-3,"Different combinations of multispectral images, multi-temporal data, and texture measures were employed to improve classification."
2958,66-4,The Grey Level Co-occurrence Matrix was used to generate texture images with different window sizes and procedures for optimal texture features and window size selection were investigated.
2959,66-5,The study evaluates how methods used in Remote Sensing could be applied on ultra-high resolution UAS images.
2960,66-6,"Combinations of original and derived bands were classified with the Maximum Likelihood algorithm, and Principal Component Analysis was conducted in order to understand the correlation between bands."
2961,66-7,"The study proves that the use of texture features produces a significant increase of the Overall Accuracy, whose values change from 58% to 78% or 87%, depending on components reduction."
2962,66-8,The improvement given by the introduction of texture measures is highlighted even in terms of User's and Producer's Accuracy.
2963,66-9,"For classification purposes, the inclusion of texture can compensate for difficulties of performing multi-temporal surveys."
2964,67-1,"Every city is-quoting Plato-divided into two, one city of the poor, the other of the rich."
2965,67-2,In this study we test whether the economic urban divide is reflected in the digital sphere of cities.
2966,67-3,"Because, especially in dynamically growing cities, ready-to-use comprehensive data sets on the urban poor, as well as on the digital divide, are not existent, we use proxies: we spatially delimit the urban poor using settlement characteristics derived from remote sensing data."
2967,67-4,The digital divide is targeted by geolocated Twitter data.
2968,67-5,"Based on a sample of eight cities across the globe, we spatially test whether areas of the urban poor are more likely to be digital cold spots."
2969,67-6,"Over the course of time, we analyze whether temporal signatures in poor urban areas differ from formal environments."
2970,67-7,We find that the economic divide influences digital participation in public life.
2971,67-8,"Less residents of morphological slums are found to be digitally oriented (""are digitally left behind"") as compared to residents of formal settlements."
2972,67-9,"However, among the few twitter users in morphological slums, we find their temporal behavior similar to the twitter users in formal settlements."
2973,67-10,"In general, we conclude this discussion, this study exemplifies that the combination of both heterogeneous data sets allows for extending the capabilities of individual disciplines for research towards urban poverty."
2974,68-1,"The utilization of the complementary information, the color feature, and the intensity-texture feature, in hue, saturation, and intensity space is limited in the change detection of multispectral images."
2975,68-2,A kernel fusing the complementary information of the color feature and the intensity-texture features is proposed.
2976,68-3,"To construct the fusion kernel, color kernel and intensity-texture kernel are constructed based on Gaussian radial basis function kernel."
2977,68-4,"Then, the kernel cross-modal factor analysis method is used to provide transformations of the kernels and the fusion kernel is obtained by multiple kernel fusion, thus achieving the capture of the complementary information."
2978,68-5,"In this way, the obtained fusion kernel highlights the changed areas and its boundary using the color features, and meanwhile provides texture-intensity change information."
2979,68-6,"Experiments on real multispectral images demonstrate the effectiveness of the fusion kernel, and illustrate that it can get smoother homogeneous areas, obtain more accurate edge locations, and provide strong noise immunity for multispectral image change detection."
2980,69-1,Downward surface solar radiation (DSSR) plays an important role in the earth's surface energy budget.
2981,69-2,"However, it has significant spatial-temporal heterogeneity over the rugged terrain."
2982,69-3,"To accurately capture DSSR, many analytical terrain parameter algorithms based on digital elevation models (DEMs) have been proposed."
2983,69-4,"However, the uncertainties of the DSSR components associated with these algorithms remain unclear."
2984,69-5,"In this letter, we compared three types of terrain parameter algorithms and their respective USSR component uncertainties at different spatial scales by using 3-D discrete anisotropic radiative model simulations under different atmospheric conditions."
2985,69-6,"The comparison results indicated that differences in slopes, sky view factors, and terrain view factors can be up to 4 degrees, 0.165 degrees, and 0.264 degrees, respectively."
2986,69-7,"For a high atmospheric visibility, the maximum discrepancies of direct solar irradiance and adjacent terrain-reflected irradiance over the high reflective surface ((e.g., fresh snow and ice)) are 26.7 and 42.8 W .m(2) , respectively."
2987,69-8,"In addition, for a low atmospheric visibility, a maximum difference of 31 W . m(2) is identified for diffuse skylight."
2988,69-9,"These uncertainties are nonnegligible when using a high-resolution DEM ((e.g., 30 m)), but as the DEM resolution becomes coarser, the uncertainties decrease."
2989,7-1,Passive ocean color remote sensing has revolutionized our ability to quantify the horizontal distribution of phytoplankton across the ocean surface.
2990,7-2,"Lidar technology can provide remotely sensed estimates of the vertical distribution of optical properties and suspended particles in natural waters, significantly improving our ability to model upper ocean biogeochemical processes."
2991,7-3,"In this study, we constructed and deployed a ship-based lidar system to measure laser backscattering and linear depolarization profiles in the coastal Mid-Atlantic ranging from estuarine to oceanic conditions, and across the Gulf of Maine (GoM)."
2992,7-4,The instrument identified layers with different backscattering intensity in stratified waters of the coastal Mid-Atlantic and produced system attenuation coefficients (K-sys) approximating the absorption coefficient (a(pg)) of particulate + dissolved matter.
2993,7-5,The linear depolarization ratio was strongly related to in situ measurements of the particulate backscattering ratio (b(bp)/b(p)).
2994,7-6,Measurements of K-sys and linear depolarization made across the GoM corresponded well with simultaneous in situ observations performed aboard the M/V Nova Star and by an autonomous glider deployed along the transect.
2995,7-7,"The relationship between K-sys, and a(pg) differed between sampling schemes, likely due to differences in the deployment geometries (e.g., height, nadir angle)."
2996,7-8,"These results support the proposition that ship-based lidar systems can provide a powerful tool for remotely measuring the vertical distributions of optical properties and geochemical constituents (e.g., particles) in the upper ocean."
2997,7-9,"Continued development of compact lidar systems for deployment on ships, moorings, and autonomous platforms has the potential to greatly improve the quality and scope of a variety of oceanographic investigations."
2998,70-1,Deep learning is a powerful technique for the analysis of remote sensing imagery.
2999,70-2,"For applications that require real-time processing on mobile platforms, a low power consumption processing unit is advantageous."
3000,70-3,The human brain is remarkably powerful at image recognition tasks while operating at very low power consumption levels.
3001,70-4,Neuromorphic computing designs aim to achieve energy efficiency through the use of spiking neurons and low-precision synapses to perform data processing.

3003,70-6,The convolutional neural-network architecture of the classifier network has been adapted to fit the neuromorphic architecture.
3004,70-7,The results on overhead imagery and hyperspectral imagery data show that neuromorphic platforms can achieve the state-of-theart performance in semantic labeling with significantly (approximate to 1000x) lower power consumption than traditional GPU-based solutions.
3005,71-1,"A novel method based on the fusion of spectral, texture, and shape features is proposed for the segmentation of high spatial resolution remote sensing images."
3006,71-2,The method uses the region merging idea to get the final segmentation result on the basis of initial segmentation.
3007,71-3,Texture features of the regions are obtained by the nonsubsampled contourlet transform.
3008,71-4,"An integrated region merging criterion is built by combining the texture, spectral, and shape features."
3009,71-5,"To ensure the efficiency of the method, the region adjacency graph and the nearest neighbor graph are used to maintain the adjacency relations in the region merging stage."
3010,71-6,The global optimization strategy is adopted to realize the image segmentation gradually.
3011,71-7,Two experiments are performed to verify the effectiveness of the proposed method.
3012,71-8,One experiment validates the influence of the merging criteria with different feature combinations on the segmentation results.
3013,71-9,Another experiment compares the effect of the method with the segmentation methods embedded in ENVI and eCognition.
3014,71-10,Experimental results show that the method can make full use of the features of the images to achieve accurate and efficient segmentations.
3015,72-1,The availability of a large amount of remote sensing data made Earth Observation increasingly accessible and detailed.
3016,72-2,High temporal and spatial resolution sensors are responsible for making available data sets of time series in unprecedented proportions.
3017,72-3,"Within this context, the use of efficient segmentation algorithms of remote sensing imagery represents an important role in this scenario, because they provide homogeneous regions in space-time and hence simplify the data set."
3018,72-4,"In addition, the spatio-temporal segmentation can bring a new way of interpreting data by means of analyzing contiguous regions in time."
3019,72-5,This letter describes a method for image segmentation applied to time series of the Earth Observation data.
3020,72-6,We adapted the traditional region growing method to detect homogeneous regions in space and time.
3021,72-7,Study cases were conducted by considering the dynamic time warping algorithm as the homogeneity criterion to grow regions.
3022,72-8,Tests on high temporal resolution image sequences from Moderate Resolution Imaging Spectroradiometer and Landsat-8 Operational Land Imager vegetation indices and comparisons with other distance measurements provided satisfactory outcomes.
3023,73-1,"Complex gravitational phenomena can require terrestrial remote sensing solutions for monitoring their possible evolution, especially when in situ installations are not possible."
3024,73-2,"This study merges terrestrial radar interferometry (TRI) and image cross-correlation (ICC) processing, which can detect complementary motion components, to obtain a 3-dimensional system able to measure the actual surface motion field of a pre-defined target."
3025,73-3,"The coupling can be carried out on data acquired from different installations of the devices, and by applying specific transformations of the related coordinate systems."
3026,73-4,The data georeferencing is a critical issue that affects the correct spatial correspondence of the data and a new approach for georeferencing radar data is proposed.
3027,73-5,The result is a spatio-temporal (3 + 1-dimensional) high-resolution representation of the surface kinematics.
3028,73-6,The presented method has been tested for the measurement of the Planpicieux glacier surface kinematics (NW of Italy).
3029,73-7,The error analysis revealed a millimeter accuracy and precision of the measurement and a georeferencing uncertainty of a few metres.
3030,74-1,Evapotranspiration (ET) is an important component of the eco-hydrological process.
3031,74-2,Comprehensive analyses of ET change at different spatial and temporal scales can enhance the understanding of hydrological processes and improve water resource management.
3032,74-3,"In this study, monthly ET data and meteorological data from 57 meteorological stations between 2000 and 2014 were used to study the spatiotemporal changes in actual ET and the associated causes in the Hai Basin."
3033,74-4,"A spatial analysis was performed in GIS to explore the spatial pattern of ET in the basin, while parametric t-test and nonparametric Mann-Kendall test methods were used to analyze the temporal characteristics of interannual and annual ET."
3034,74-5,The primary causes of the spatiotemporal variations were partly explained by detrended fluctuation analysis.
3035,74-6,"The results were as follows: (i) generally, ET increased from northwest to southeast across the basin, with significant differences in ET due to the heterogeneous landscape."
3036,74-7,"Notably, the ET of water bodies was highest, followed by those of paddy fields, forests, cropland, brush, grassland and settlement; (ii) from 2000 to 2014, annual ET exhibited an increasing trend of 3.7 mm per year across the basin, implying that the excessive utilization of water resources had not been alleviated and the water resource crisis worsened; (iii) changes in vegetation coverage, wind speed and air pressure were the major factors that influenced interannual ET trends."
3037,74-8,Temperature and NDVI largely explained the increases in ET in 2014 and can be used as indicators to evaluate annual ET and provide early warning for associated issues.
3038,75-1,"Time-sequence remote sensing images are usually captured under varying acquisition conditions due to atmospheric differences, lighting condition, humidity etc."
3039,75-2,Comparing the spectral values of the well-registered images taken at a different time is a complicated issue due to the non-linear spectrum distortion caused by these effects.
3040,75-3,"Atmospheric correction can eliminate part of the errors, while precisely removing it requires many other in-situ data such as the weather condition and optical aerosol depth."
3041,75-4,We propose an algorithm that performs spatial-temporal inferences that correct the spectral values through a data-driven approach - we developed a simple 3D spatiotemporal filtering method that uses the time-sequence imagery themselves to homogenize the spectral property of similar objects while being heterogeneous to objects with significant differences.
3042,75-5,"We have performed extensive experiments using medium resolution Landsat dataset and high-resolution Planet imagery, by evaluating the classification results from both classic machine learning (sample selected from the current image) and transfer learning (samples selected from one dataset and applied to the other dataset)."
3043,75-6,"The experiments results show that the proposed 3D spatiotemporal filter can improve the accuracy of classification using transfer learning by approximate to 5%, approximate to 15%, and = approximate to 2%."
3044,75-7,We have also demonstrated that the enhanced time-sequence image offers much better change detection outputs using just a simple image differencing method.
3045,75-8,The improved results in typical remote sensing tasks indicate our proposed method being effective for time-sequence data preprocessing.
3046,76-1,"Every year, large areas of savannas and woodlands burn due to natural conditions and land management practices."
3047,76-2,"Given the relevant level of greenhouse gas emissions produced by biomass burning in tropical regions, it is becoming even more important to clearly define historic fire regimes so that prospective emission reduction management strategies can be well informed, and their results Measured, Reported, and Verified (MRV)."
3048,76-3,"Thus, developing tools for accurately, and periodically mapping burned areas, based on cost advantageous, expedite, and repeatable rigorous approaches, is important."
3049,76-4,The main objective of this study is to investigate the potential of novel Genetic Programming (GP) methodologies for classifying burned areas in satellite imagery over savannas and tropical woodlands and to assess if they can improve over the popular and currently applied methods of Maximum Likelihood classification and Classification and Regression Tree analysis.
3050,76-5,"The tests are performed using three Landsat images from Brazil (South America), Guinea-Bissau (West Africa) and the Democratic Republic of Congo (Central Africa)."
3051,76-6,Burned areas were digitized on-screen to produce mapped information serving as surrogate ground-truth.
3052,76-7,"Validation results show that all methods provide an overestimation of burned area, but GP achieves higher accuracy values in two of the three cases."
3053,76-8,"GP is the most versatile machine learning method available today, but still largely underused in remote sensing."
3054,76-9,"This study shows that standard GP can produce better results than two classical methods, and illustrates its versatility and potential in becoming a mainstream method for more difficult tasks involving the large amounts of newly available data."
3055,77-1,"Chromophoric dissolved organic matter (CDOM), the key component in aquatic environment, plays an important role in biogeochemical processing."
3056,77-2,"In this study, in situ reflectance and water samples were used to develop models for estimating CDOM absorption in a complex freshwater environment in Poyang Lake, China."
3057,77-3,"The in situ water reflectance spectra, CDOM absorption spectra and other water-color parameters from 92 samples collected in four representative study areas between 2015 and 2016 were analysed."
3058,77-4,Band ratio models were established to estimate CDOM absorption coefficient at 355 nm [a(g)(355)] based on the correlation analysis between reflectance and a(g)(355).
3059,77-5,The results indicated that the models performed well for estimating a(g)(355) when the 92 samples were divided into two datasets with the threshold of concentration of total suspended matter (TSM) as 10 mg/L.
3060,77-6,"The band ratios of R(689)/R(497) and R(767)/R(826) were selected to establish models for retrieval of a(g)(355) in clean water (TSM < 10 mg/L) and turbid water (TSM >= 10 mg/L), respectively."
3061,77-7,"The determination coefficients (r(2)) of calibration models for clean and turbid water were 0.70 and 0.73, respectively."
3062,77-8,"The percentage root-mean-square errors (%RSME) of validation models for clean and turbid water were 13.2% and 11.6%, respectively."
3063,77-9,The simulated Sentinel-2 and Landsat-8 bands based on reflectance spectra were used to examine potential capability for retrieving CDOM using these sensors.
3064,77-10,The results indicated that Sentinel-2 performed better than Landsat-8 for estimating a(g)(355).
3065,77-11,"The Sentinel-2 band ratio of B4/B2 or B5/B2 and B7/B8 or B7/B8A are effective for retrieval of CDOM in clean and turbid water of Poyang Lake, respectively."
3066,78-1,Accurate and repeatable mapping of biological plant invasions is essential to develop successful management strategies for conserving native biodiversity.
3067,78-2,"While overstory invasive plants have been successfully detected and mapped using multiple methods, understory invasive detection remains a challenge, particularly in dense forested environments."
3068,78-3,Very few studies have utilized an approach that identifies and aligns the acquisition timing of remote sensing imagery with peak phenological differences between understory and overstory vegetation types.
3069,78-4,"We investigated this opportunity by analyzing a monthly time-series of 2011 Landsat TM data to identify acquisition periods with the highest phenological differences between understory and overstory vegetation for detecting the spatial distribution of the exotic understory plant Ligustrum sinense Lour., a rapidly spreading invader in urbanizing regions of the southeastern United States."
3070,78-5,"We used vegetation indices (VI) to establish intra-annual phonological trends for L. sinense, evergreen forest, and deciduous forest located in Mecklenburg County, North Carolina, USA."
3071,78-6,We developed Random Forest (RF) models to detect L. sinense from those time steps exhibiting the highest phonological differences.
3072,78-7,We assessed the relative contribution of VI and topographic indices (TI) to the detection of L. sinense.
3073,78-8,We compared the top performing models and used the best overall model to produce a map of L. sinense for the study area.
3074,78-9,"RF models that included VI, TI, and Landsat TM bands for March 13 and 29, 2011 (the periods with highest detected phonological differences), produced the highest overall accuracy and Kappa estimates, outperforming the combination of VI and TI by 8.5% in accuracy and 20.5% in Kappa."
3075,78-10,The top performing model from the RF produced a Kappa of 0.75.
3076,78-11,Our findings suggest that selecting remote sensing data for a period when phenological differences between L. sinense and forest types are at their peak can improve the detection and mapping of L. sinense.
3077,79-1,Object-based image classification is recognized as one of the best strategies to analyze high spatial resolution remote sensing images.
3078,79-2,"This process includes defining scale parameters to form regions sharing similar characteristics such as color, texture, or shape."
3079,79-3,"Traditionally, in an object-based supervised classification setting the image is classified only after the segmentation process is completed."
3080,79-4,"However, when the imaged objects on the ground are heterogeneous and of different sizes, some resulting segments can be appropriate for classification while others are over or under-segmented."
3081,79-5,This may cause partial failure of the subsequent classification.
3082,79-6,"In this paper, we introduce a simultaneous approach based on the interception of the segmentation stage by provisional classification of under-growing segments."
3083,79-7,Our proposal is to optimize the classification process by iteratively updating the labels of previously generated regions only if the estimated posterior probabilities of the winning classes in the new segments increase.
3084,79-8,"Experiments with three multispectral datasets acquired by Landsat-5 TM, QuickBird-II, and WorldView-3 in rural and urban areas compare traditional object-based approach based on region growing with the proposed method using well-established classifiers."
3085,79-9,"Our results show that the proposed method becomes much less sensitive to the choice of segmentation parameters and reaches similar, or even better, classification accuracies."
3086,8-1,A novel approach to characterize the physiological conditions of plants from hyperspectral remote sensing data through the numerical inversion of a light version of the SCOPE model is proposed.
3087,8-2,The combined retrieval of vegetation biochemical and biophysical parameters and Sun-induced chlorophyll fluorescence (F) was investigated exploiting high resolution spectral measurements in the visible and near-infrared spectral regions.
3088,8-3,"First, the retrieval scheme was evaluated against a synthetic dataset."
3089,8-4,"Then, it was applied to very high resolution (sub-nanometer) canopy level spectral measurements collected over a lawn treated with different doses of a herbicide (Chlorotoluron) known to instantaneously inhibit both Photochemical and Non-Photochemical Quenching (PQ and NPQ, respectively)."
3090,8-5,"For the first time the full spectrum of canopy F, the fluorescence quantum yield (Phi(F)), as well as the main vegetation parameters that control light absorption and reabsorption, were retrieved concurrently using canopy-level high resolution apparent reflectance (rho*) spectra."
3091,8-6,"The effects of pigment content, leaf/canopy structural properties and physiology were effectively discriminated."
3092,8-7,Their combined observation over time led to the recognition of dynamic patterns of stress adaptation and stress recovery.
3093,8-8,"As a reference, F values obtained with the model inversion were compared to those retrieved with state of the art Spectral Fitting Methods (SFM) and SpecFit retrieval algorithms applied on field data."
3094,8-9,Phi(F) retrieved from rho* was eventually compared with an independent biophysical model of photosynthesis and fluorescence.
3095,8-10,These results foster the use of repeated hyperspectral remote sensing observations together with radiative transfer and biochemical models for plant status monitoring.
3096,80-1,Phenological events of tree leaves from initiation to senescence is generally influenced by temperature and water availability.
3097,80-2,"Detection of newly grown leaves (NGL) is useful in the diagnosis of growth of trees, tree stress and even climatic change."
3098,80-3,"Utilizing very high resolution UAV images, this paper examines the feasibility of NGL detection using hyperspectral detection algorithms and anomaly detectors."
3099,80-4,The issues of pixel resolution and hard decision thresholding in deriving accurate NGL maps are also explored.
3100,80-5,"Results showed that the blind-detection algorithms RXDs are not suitable for NGL detection due to the spectra similarity between NGL and both mature leaves and grass, while brighter pixels, such as those produced by soil and concrete materials, are more easily recognized as anomaly in contrast to forest."
3101,80-6,"Matching filter (MF) based detectors are, however, able to accurately detect NGL over forest stands and are even more effective in the sense of achieving satisfactory true positives and true negatives while providing minimal false alarms."
3102,80-7,"Of the tested partial knowledge MF algorithms, the covariance matched filter based distance (KMFD) detector performed very well with overall accuracy (OA) 0.97 and kappa coefficient ((k) over cap) 0.60 on a natural resolution of 6.75 cm image."
3103,80-8,"When a variety of mature-leaf nonobjective targets are included in the detection, the orthogonal subspace projector (OSP) tends to suppress NGL pixels as an unwanted signature and this leads to poor detection."
3104,80-9,"Conversely, the target constrained interference minimized filter (TCIMF) detector is still able to effectively detect NGL with a satisfactory OA and (k) over cap through effective matching filter of the target signature as the hard-decision threshold is subject to a level of 5% or 1% probability of false alarms."
3105,80-10,"From decimeter resolution satellite images, the KMFD and TCIMF detectors are capable of achieving an accuracy of OA = 0.94 and (k ) over cap= 0.56 or OA = 0.87 and (k) over cap= 0.48 for images with a resolution of 33.75 cm or 67.50 cm respectively."
3106,80-11,This indicates that hyperspectral target detection techniques have great potential in NGL detection via high spatial resolution satellite multispectral images.
3107,81-1,Diurnal land surface temperature cycle (DTC) models are useful tools for generating continuous diurnal land surface temperature (LST) dynamics from temporally sparse satellite observations.
3108,81-2,"Four-parameter DTC models (FPD) can be applied to tandem polar-orbiting satellite observations that sample the surface at least four times per day and, therefore, they have received especial attention."
3109,81-3,"Different approaches have been proposed to reduce the parameter number of DTC models to only four, but a comprehensive and systematic comparison of the published FPDs and their performance is lacking."
3110,81-4,"In addition, it remains unclear whether there are even better parameter-reduction approaches (PRAs) for DTC modeling when only four observations per day are available."
3111,81-5,"Consequently, we chose three semi-empirical DTC models (GOT01, INA08, and GOT09) and one quasi-physical DTC model (GEM) and obtained nine FPDs with PRAs ((e.g., by fixing some of the DTC parameters as constants))."
3112,81-6,Using in-situ thermal observations from the U.S.
3113,81-7,"Climate Reference Network, as well as LSTs from the geostationary MSG and FY-2F satellites under clear sky, we compared the performances of these nine FPDs for 24 and 4 available LST observations per day."
3114,81-8,"We obtained the following results: (1) The GOT09- and GEM-type models generally performed better than the other models with in-situ measurements, while the INA08-ts and GOT09-type models possessed high accuracies for the geostationary LSTs. (2) For the semi-empirical models, the PRA 't(s) = t(ss )- 1' (where t(s), and t(ss) are the onsets of nighttime cooling and sunset, respectively) is generally more accurate than the PRA 'delta T=0' (where delta T is the day-to-day change of residual temperature)."
3115,81-9,"The only exception is the GOT09-type model, for which the 't(s) = t(ss) - 1' strategy is less accurate. (3) GOT09-dT-tau, which fixes delta T as zero and the atmospheric optical thickness (tau) as 0.01 for parameter reduction, shows the best performance of the FPDs."
3116,81-10,"The study gives an overview of commonly-used four-parameter DTC models, provides a foundation for generating spatio-temporally continuous LST products, and offers guidance for choosing four-parameter DTC models in various applications."
3117,82-1,Local invariant features from computer vision community have recently been widely applied to the matching of remote sensing images.
3118,82-2,"However, these features are mainly designed to handle geometric distortions, and are sensitive to complex radiometric differences between multisensor images."
3119,82-3,"To address this issue, this paper proposes an effective local invariant feature that is sufficiently robust to both geometric and radiometric changes."
3120,82-4,The proposed feature is built based on the phase congruency model that is invariant to illumination and contrast variation.
3121,82-5,It consists of a feature detector named MMPC-Lap and a feature descriptor named local histogram of orientated phase congruency (LHOPC).
3122,82-6,"MMPC-Lap is constructed by using the minimum moment of phase congruency for feature detection with an automatic scale location technique, which is used to detect stable keypoints in image scale space."
3123,82-7,"Subsequently, LHOPC derives the feature descriptor for a keypoint by utilizing an extended phase congruency feature with an advanced descriptor configuration."
3124,82-8,"Finally, correspondences are achieved by evaluating the similarity of the feature descriptors."
3125,82-9,"The proposed MMPC-Lap and LHOPC have been evaluated under different imaging conditions (spectral, temporal, and scale changes)."
3126,82-10,"The results obtained on a variety of remote sensing images demonstrate its excellent performance with respect to the state-of-the-art local invariant features, especially for cases where there are complex radiometric differences."
3127,83-1,Damage to agricultural crops due to water-logging is becoming more frequent in this era of global climate change.
3128,83-2,"In this study, we investigated the effect of water-logging on winter wheat growth (LAI and aboveground biomass) and yield at a parcel scale using high spatial resolution satellite data."
3129,83-3,"For this purpose, a dynamic mapping of winter wheat LAI and biomass during growth under water-logging conditions was implemented."
3130,83-4,"In addition, yield mapping and yield loss estimation were also carried out to arrive at the potential impacts of water-logging on both winter wheat growth and grain yield."
3131,83-5,"Two varieties of winter wheat were investigated (Yang Mai 14 and Yang Mai 18) at tillering, jointing to booting and flowering."
3132,83-6,"Field conditions were representative of water-logging treatment (contrast check (CK), waterlogging (WL) and flooding (FL))."
3133,83-7,"A total of eight high spatial resolution optical satellite images, including WorldView-2, WorldView-3, Pleiades-1A, SPOT-6, GeoEye-1 and SPOT-7 were obtained at time points concurrent with eight temporal field observations."
3134,83-8,"Seven widely used vegetation indices (VIs) were utilized as independent variables for LAI, biomass and yield estimation."
3135,83-9,"Optimal estimation models were selected according to coefficient of determination (R-2), correlation coefficient (R) and root mean square error (RMSE) for subsequent mapping of LAI, biomass and yield."
3136,83-10,"Results show that the power model, having EVI as the independent variable, had the highest accuracy for biomass estimation (R-2 of 0.78 and RMSE of 0.076 kg/m(2)) while the exponential model with NDVI is the optimal model for LAI estimation (with 0.74 in R-2 and 0.64 in RMSE)."
3137,83-11,"GNDVI is the optimal VI for yield mapping, with 0.563 in R-cv (cross validated R) and 843.76 kg/hm(2 )in RMSEcv (cross validated RMSEcv)."
3138,83-12,"As for the assessment of waterlogging damage on winter wheat growth, FL showed a more serious impact than that of WL, based on results of the dynamic mapping of biomass and LAI at the same development stages."
3139,83-13,Water-logging from jointing to booting showed a more serious damage impact with respect to biomass and yield than that at the tillering and flowering stages.
3140,83-14,"Our results have demonstrated the potential of multi-source and high spatial resolution remotely-sensed optical data for quantifying the impact of water-logging on winter wheat growth and grain yield at parcel scales, a research direction that has rarely been reported in agricultural remote sensing literature."
3141,83-15,"This study thus provides a fundamental basis and the possibility for crop yield loss evaluation, water-logging monitoring, and for the design of mitigation strategies that would benefit even small-holder and subsistence farmers."
3142,84-1,Point cloud data derived from stereo satellite imagery has the potential to provide large-scale forest inventory assessment but these methods are known to include higher error than airborne laser scanning (ALS).
3143,84-2,This study compares the accuracy of forest inventory attributes estimated from high-density ALS (21.1 pulses m(-2)) point cloud data (PCD) and PCD derived from photogrammetric methods applied to stereo satellite imagery obtained over a Pinus radiata D.
3144,84-3,Don plantation forest in New Zealand.
3145,84-4,The statistical and textural properties of the canopy height models (CHMs) derived from each point cloud were included alongside standard PCD metrics as a means of improving the accuracy of predictions for key forest inventory attributes.
3146,84-5,"For mean top height (a measure of dominant height in a stand), ALS data produced better estimates (R-2 = 0.88; RMSE = 1.7 m) than those obtained from satellite data (R-2 = 0.81; RMSE = 2.1 m)."
3147,84-6,This was attributable to a general over-estimation of canopy heights in the satellite PCD.
3148,84-7,"ALS models produced poor estimates of stand density (R-2 = 0.48; RMSE = 112.1 stems ha(-1)), as did the satellite PCD models (R-2 = 0.42; RMSE = 118.4 stems ha(-1))."
3149,84-8,"ALS models produced accurate estimates of basal area (R-2 = 0.58; RMSE = 12 m(2) ha(-1)), total stem volume (R-2 = 0.72; RMSE = 107.5 m(3) ha(-1)), and total recoverable volume (R-2 = 0.74; RMSE = 92.9 m(3) ha(-1))."
3150,84-9,"These values differed little from the estimates of basal area (R-2 = 0.57; RMSE = 12.2 m(2) ha(-1)), total stem volume (R-2 = 0.70; RMSE = 112.6 m(3) ha(-1)), and total recoverable volume (R-2 = 0.73; RMSE = 96 m(3) ha(-1)) obtained from satellite PCD models."
3151,84-10,"The statistical and textural metrics computed from the CHMs were important variables in all of the models derived from both satellite and ALS PCD, nearly always outranking the standard PCD metrics in measures of importance."
3152,84-11,"For the satellite PCD models, the CHM-derived metrics were nearly exclusively identified as important variables."
3153,84-12,These results clearly show that point cloud data obtained from stereo satellite imagery are useful for prediction of forest inventory attributes in intensively managed forests on steeper terrain.
3154,84-13,"Furthermore, these data offer forest managers the benefit of obtaining both inventory data and high-resolution multispectral imagery from a single product."
3155,85-1,The gain-loss approach for greenhouse gas inventories requires estimates of areas of human activity and estimates of emissions per unit area for each activity.
3156,85-2,Stratified sampling and estimation have emerged as a popular and useful statistical approach for estimation of activity areas.
3157,85-3,"With this approach, a map depicting classes of activity is used to stratify the area of interest."
3158,85-4,"For each map class used as a stratum, map units are randomly selected and assessed with respect to an attribute such as forest/non-forest or forest land cover change."
3159,85-5,Ground observations are generally accepted as the most accurate source of information for these assessments but may be cost-prohibitive to acquire for remote and inaccessible forest regions.
3160,85-6,"In lieu of ground observations, visual interpretations of remotely sensed data such as aerial imagery or satellite imagery are often used with the caveat that the interpretations must be of greater quality than the map data."
3161,85-7,An unresolved issue pertains to the effects of interpreter error on the bias and precision of the stratified estimators of activity areas.
3162,86-1,"Many applications dedicated to urban areas (e.g. land cover mapping and biophysical properties estimation) using high spatial resolution remote sensing images require the use of 3D atmospheric correction methods, able to model complex light interactions within urban topography such as buildings and trees."
3163,86-2,"Currently, one major drawback of these methods is their lack in modeling the radiative signature of trees (e.g. the light transmitted through the tree crown), which leads to an over-estimation of ground reflectance at tree shadows."
3164,86-3,No study has been carried out to take into account both optical and structural properties of trees in the correction provided by these methods.
3165,86-4,"The aim of this work is to improve an existing 3D atmospheric correction method, ICARE (Inversion Code for urban Areas Reflectance Extraction), to account for trees in its new version, ICARE-VEG (ICARE with VEGetation)."
3166,86-5,"After the execution of ICARE, the methodology of ICARE-VEG consists in tree crown delineation and tree shadow detection, and then the application of a physics-based correction factor in order to perform a tree-specific local correction for each pixel in tree shadow."
3167,86-6,"A sensitivity analysis with a design of experiments performed with a 3D canopy radiative transfer code, DART (Discrete Anisotropic Radiative Transfer), results in fixing the two most critical variables contributing to the impact of an isolated tree crown on the radiative energy budget at tree shadow: the solar zenith angle and the tree leaf area index (LAI)."
3168,86-7,"Thus, the approach to determine the correction factor relies on an empirical statistical regression and the addition of a geometric scaling factor to account for the tree crown occultation from ground."
3169,86-8,"ICARE-VEG and ICARE performance were compared and validated in the Visible-Near Infrared Region (V-NIR: 0.4-1.0 mu m) with hyperspectral airborne data at 0.8 m resolution on three ground materials types, grass, asphalt and water."
3170,86-9,"Results show that (i) ICARE-VEG improves the mean absolute error in retrieved reflectances compared to ICARE in tree shadows by a multiplicative factor ranging between 4.2 and 18.8, and (ii) reduces the spectral bias in reflectance from visible to NIR (due to light transmission through the tree crown) by a multiplicative factor between 1.0 and 1.4 in terms of spectral angle mapper performance."
3171,86-10,"ICARE-VEG opens the way to a complete interpretation of remote sensing images (sunlit, shade cast by both buildings and trees) and the derivation of scientific value-added products over all the entire image without the preliminary step of shadow masking."
3172,87-1,The study demonstrates the application of geospatial technologies to evaluate physical resources of semi-arid watersheds and presents a comprehensive methodology applicable elsewhere.
3173,87-2,"The selected Andipatti watershed, located in Theni district in the State of Tamil Nadu (India), is known for agricultural activities: however, haphazard planning, management practices and inadequate investments result in land and water resource degradation."
3174,87-3,"Since most of the agricultural lands in developing countries are similar to these conditions, the present study is attempted as a case to develop a framework to assess the land and water resources potential, utilisation level and land suitability for agriculture; and to evolve better management strategies."
3175,87-4,"The physical characteristics of the watershed were studied based on in-situ, remotely sensed and secondary data sources."
3176,87-5,"Thematic layers were generated with the combination of remote sensing, image processing and GIS techniques."
3177,87-6,"In order to characterize and quantify the watershed based on soil erosion and surface runoff rates, the revised universal soil loss equation (RUSLE) and natural resources conservation services curve number (NRCS-CN) were utilized."
3178,87-7,"Data on water levels and geochemistry of water samples, collected from 36 dug wells were also utilized for this study."
3179,87-8,"Sodium adsorption ratio (SAR) and electrical conductivity, as formulated by the US Salinity Laboratory (USSL) were utilized to examine the suitability of groundwater for irrigation purpose."
3180,87-9,The stone index has been used to assess the productivity of land using profile and textural characteristics of the soil.
3181,87-10,"Keeping Food and Agricultural Organisation (FAO) guidelines as a reference, as many as 727 homogenous micro-land units were prepared."
3182,87-11,The physical land qualities and characteristics of each land unit were compared with the requirements of 13 major crops of the study area and suitable crops for each unit were identified.
3183,87-12,The individual suitability classes of all crops were compared using logical analysis and suitability crops for each land unit were determined under irrigated and rain-fed conditions.
3184,87-13,"In order to integrate the results of these analyses and to suggest sustainable agricultural development measures, the study area was divided into 44 micro-watersheds."
3185,87-14,"The information on land productivity, groundwater quality and existing land use/land cover patterns of the watershed were used to calculate land potential-utilisation index and groundwater potential-utilisation ratio for all micro-watersheds."
3186,87-15,All the results of land and water resources assessment were compared and a proposed land use map was prepared.
3187,87-16,"The findings suggest strategies for coping with sustainable agricultural practices for the present study area and provide an integrated methodology for future assessments elsewhere, especially in the developing countries."
3188,88-1,The most recent Global Slavery Index estimates that there are 40.3 million people enslaved globally.
3189,88-2,"The UN's Agenda 2030 for Sustainable Development Goal number 8, section 8.7 specifically refers to the issue of forced labour: ending modern slavery and human trafficking, including child labour, in all forms by 2025."
3190,88-3,"Although there is a global political commitment to ending slavery, one of the biggest barriers to doing so is having reliable and timely, spatially explicit and scalable data on slavery activity."
3191,88-4,The lack of these data compromises evidence-based action and policy formulation.
3192,88-5,"Thus, to meet the challenge of ending modern slavery new and innovative approaches, with an emphasis on efficient use of resources (including financial) are needed."
3193,88-6,This paper demonstrates the fundamental role of remote sensing as a source of evidence.
3194,88-7,We provide an estimate of the number of brick kilns across the 'Brick Belt' that runs across south Asia.
3195,88-8,This is important because these brick kilns are known sites of modern-day slavery.
3196,88-9,"This paper reports the first rigorous estimate of the number of brick kilns present and does so using a robust method that can be easily adopted by key agencies for evidence-based action ((i.e, NGOs, etc.)) and is based on freely available and accessible remotely sensed data."
3197,88-10,"From this estimate we can not only calculate the scale of the slavery problem in the Brick Belt, but also calculate the impact of slavery beyond that of the enslaved people themselves, on, for example, environmental change and impacts on ecosystem services this links to other Sustainable Development Goals."
3198,88-11,"As the process of achieving key Sustainable Development Goal targets will show, there are global benefits to ending slavery - this will mean a better world for everyone: safer, greener, more prosperous, and more equal."
3199,88-12,This is termed here a Freedom Dividend.
3200,89-1,"Cultural Heritage (CH) is recognised as being of historical, social, and anthropological value and is considered as an enabler of sustainable development."
3201,89-2,"As a result, it is included in the United Nations' Sustainable Development Goals (SDGs) 11 and 8."
3202,89-3,"SDG 11.4 emphasises the protection and safeguarding of heritage, and SDG 8.9 aims to promote sustainable tourism that creates jobs and promotes local culture and products."
3203,89-4,"This paper briefly reviews the geoinformatics technologies of photogrammetry, remote sensing, and spatial information science and their application to CH."
3204,89-5,"Detailed aspects of CH-related SDGs, comprising protection and safeguarding, as well as the promotion of sustainable tourism are outlined."
3205,89-6,Contributions of geoinformatics technologies to each of these aspects are then identified and analysed.
3206,89-7,"Case studies in both developing and developed countries, supported by funding directed at the UNSDGs, are presented to illustrate the challenges and opportunities of geoinformatics to enhance CH protection and to promote sustainable tourism."
3207,89-8,"The potential and impact of geoinformatics for the measurement of official SDG indicators, as well as UNESCO's Culture for Development Indicators, are discussed."
3208,89-9,"Based on analysis of the review and the presented case studies, it is concluded that the contribution of geoinformatics to the achievement of CH SDGs is necessary, significant and evident."
3209,89-10,"Moreover, following the UNESCO initiative to introduce CH into the sustainable development agenda and related ICOMOS action plan, the concept of Sustainable Cultural Heritage is defined, reflecting the significance of CH to the United Nations' ambition to ""transform our world""."
3210,9-1,"Remote sensing data are most useful if they are available with sufficient precision, accuracy, spatiotemporal and spectral sampling, as well as continuity across decades."
3211,9-2,"The Landsat and Sentinel series, as well other satellites are currently covering significant parts of this observational trade space."
3212,9-3,It can be expected that growing demands and budget constraints will require new capabilities in orbit that can address as many observables as possible with a single instrument.
3213,9-4,Recent optical performance improvements of imaging spectrometers make them true alternatives to traditional multispectral imagers.
3214,9-5,"However, they are much more adaptable to a wide range of Earth observation needs due to the combination of continuous high spectral sampling with spatial sampling consistent with previous sensors (e.g., Landsat)."
3215,9-6,"Unfortunately, there is a knowledge gap in demonstrating that imaging spectroscopy data can substitute for multi-spectral data while sustaining the long-term record."
3216,9-7,"Thus, the objective of this analysis is to test the hypothesis that imaging spectroscopy data compare radiometrically with multi-spectral data to within 5%."
3217,9-8,"Using a coincident Airborne Visible/Infrared Imaging Spectrometer (AVIRIS) flight with over-passing Operational Land Imager (OLI) data on Landsat 8, we document a procedure for simulating OLI multi-spectral bands from AVIRIS data, evaluate influencing factors on the observed radiance, and assess the difference in top-of-atmosphere radiance as compared to OLI."
3218,9-9,"The procedure for simulating OLI data include spectral convolution, accounting for the minimal atmospheric effects between the two sensors, and spatial resampling."
3219,9-10,"The remaining differences between the simulated and the real OLI data result mainly from differences in sensor calibration, surface bi-directional reflectance, and spatial sampling."
3220,9-11,The median relative radiometric difference for each band ranges from - 8.3% to 0.6%.
3221,9-12,"After bias-correction to minimize potential calibration discrepancies, we find no more than a 1.2% relative difference."
3222,9-13,This analysis therefore successfully demonstrates that imaging spectrometer data can contribute to Landsat-type or other multi-spectral data records.
3223,9-14,It also shows that cross-calibration from a spectrometer to a radiometer can be easily performed as a result of the imaging spectrometer high spectral sampling and its ability to recreate multi-spectral response functions.
3224,90-1,"Remote sensing technology is an essential link in the global monitoring of the ocean surface, and radars are efficient sensors for detecting marine pollution."
3225,90-2,"When used operationally by authorities, a tradeoff must usually be made between the covered area and the quantity of information collected by the radar."
3226,90-3,"To identify the most appropriate imaging mode, a methodology based on receiver operating characteristic curve analysis has been applied to an original data set collected by two airborne systems operating at L-hand, both characterized by a very low instrument noise floor."
3227,90-4,The data set was acquired during controlled releases of mineral and vegetable oil at sea.
3228,90-5,"Various polarization-dependent quantities are investigated, and their ability to detect slick-covered areas is assessed."
3229,90-6,A relative ordering of the main polarimetric parameters is reported in this paper.
3230,90-7,"When the sensor has a sufficiently low noise floor, HV is recommended because it provides the strongest slick- sea contrast."
3231,90-8,"Otherwise, VV is found to be the most relevant parameter for detecting slicks on the ocean surface."
3232,90-9,"Among all the investigated quad-polarimetric settings, no significant added value compared to single-polarized data was found."
3233,90-10,"More specifically, it is demonstrated, by increasing the instrument noise level, that the studied polarimetric quantities which combine the four polarimetric channels have performances of detection mainly driven by the instrument noise floor, namely, the noise equivalent sigma zero."
3234,90-11,"This result, obtained by progressively adding noise to the raw synthetic aperture radar (SAR) data, indicates that the polarimetric discrimination between clean sea and polluted area results mainly from the differentiated behavior between single-bounce scattering and noise."
3235,90-12,"It is thus demonstrated, using SAR data collected with a low instrument noise floor, that there is no deviation from Bragg scattering for radar scattering from ocean surface covered by mineral and vegetable oil."
3236,91-1,"The mapping of urban areas at regional to global scales is a crucial task due to its value for environmental monitoring, habitat and biodiversity conservation, and decision-making."
3237,91-2,"In most current applications, two techniques (i.e., supervised classification and data fusion) are widely applied in large-scale urban mapping."
3238,91-3,"However, the costly training sample collection, inadequate data-source descriptions, and diverse urban characteristics (e.g., shape, size, socioeconomic status, and physical environment) are challenging problems for the urban mapping approaches."
3239,91-4,"In this context, aiming at effectively deriving accurate urban areas at a large scale, we propose a novel ensemble support vector machine (SVM) method which consists of three steps: 1) the automatic generation of training data to reduce labor costs; 2) the construction of an ensemble SVM model to effectively combine the multisource data (including remote sensing and socioeconomic data); and 3) an adaptive patch-based thresholding technique to tackle the diverse urban characteristics."
3240,91-5,"The proposed method is employed to map urban areas of China in 2005 and 2010, and the resulting maps are compared with the existing urban maps for 287 prefecture-level cities."
3241,91-6,"It is found that our results present a satisfactory superiority, especially in challenging small cities, with a significant improvement in median Kappa (0.174 for 2005 and 0.203 for 2010)."
3242,91-7,"When incorporating moderate-resolution imaging spectroradiometer multispectral data as an additional source, the Kappa coefficient can be further raised by 0.028 for 2010."
3243,91-8,"In general, the proposed method shows great potential for accurately mapping urban areas at regional, continental, or even global scales in a cost-effective manner."
3244,92-1,"Because of the internal malfunction of satellite sensors and poor atmospheric conditions such as thick cloud, the acquired remote sensing data often suffer from missing information, i.e., the data usability is greatly reduced."
3245,92-2,"In this paper, a novel method of missing information reconstruction in remote sensing images is proposed."
3246,92-3,The unified spatial-temporal-spectral framework based on a deep convolutional neural network (CNN) employs a unified deep CNN combined with spatial-temporal-spectral supplementary information.
3247,92-4,"In addition, to address the fact that most methods can only deal with a single missing information reconstruction task, the proposed approach can solve three typical missing information reconstruction tasks: 1) dead lines in Aqua Moderate Resolution Imaging Spectroradiometer hand 6; 2) the Landsat Enhanced Thematic Mapper Plus scan line corrector-off problem; and 3) thick cloud removal."
3248,92-5,"It should he noted that the proposed model can use multisource data (spatial, spectral, and temporal) as the input of the unified framework."
3249,92-6,The results of both simulated and real-data experiments demonstrate that the proposed model exhibits high effectiveness in the three missing information reconstruction tasks listed above.
3250,93-1,The land surface reflectance data are indispensable to generate many other land products.
3251,93-2,Global land surface reflectance data have been routinely produced from remote sensing sensors aboard different satellite platforms.
3252,93-3,"However, the original data, especially the daily data, suffer from a large number of spatial gaps, which result from atmospheric contamination and instrument deficiencies."
3253,93-4,This seriously limits their further applications.
3254,93-5,"Many composite products with less spatial gaps have been generated to solve the above problem, but they easily sacrifice their temporal resolutions of original data."
3255,93-6,"Even worse, they cannot he directly implemented in realistic applications because of the noise and composite seams."
3256,93-7,This paper proposes a temporal-spatial reconstruction method (TSRM) to generate daily gapless and seamless land surface reflectance data.
3257,93-8,The TSRM integrates both temporal and spatial information for recovering different land cover types using three processing steps.
3258,93-9,"First, spatial gaps are coarsely filled with multiyear weighted average (Step1)."
3259,93-10,"After that, all the gaps that are not filled in the first step are interpolated by using harmonic analysis of time series with true value constraint (Step2)."
3260,93-11,"Finally, the reconstructed results in the last step are seamlessly processed using the Poisson image editing method, and the seamless daily reflectance data set is generated (Step3)."
3261,93-12,The Moderate Resolution Imaging Spectroradiometer reflectance data set (MOD09GA and MYD09GA) on two testing areas is selected to verify the performance of the proposed TSRM.
3262,93-13,Experimental results show that the TSRM has good performance with regard to maintaining the temporal and spatial integrity of the daily land surface reflectance data.
3263,93-14,Results on different testing sites also demonstrate that the TSRM preserves spectral integrity with clear seasonal trends for each spectral band.
3264,94-1,"Band selection (BS) is a special case of the feature selection problem, and it tries to remove redundant bands and select a few informative and distinctive hands to represent the whole image cube."
3265,94-2,The maximum ellipsoid volume (MEV) method regards the band subset with the maximum volume as the optimal band combination.
3266,94-3,"However, the MEV method cannot he directly applied for hyperspectral imagery due to the high dimensionality of the data sets."
3267,94-4,"Therefore, we first combine MEV with the sequential forward search (SFS) and propose a new unsupervised BS method called MEV-SFS."
3268,94-5,"Furthermore, a subtle relationship between the ellipsoid volume of the band set and the orthogonal projections (OPs) of the candidate bands is observed."
3269,94-6,"Based on this relationship, we propose another equivalent method, namely, the OP-based BS (OPBS) method."
3270,94-7,"OPBS is the fast version of MEV-SFS, and it has a better computational efficiency and the potential to determine the number of hands to be selected."
3271,94-8,We specifically explain the rationality of the MEV-based methods (MEV-SFS and OPBS) and illustrate their theoretical significance and physical meaning from different aspects.
3272,94-9,"Theoretical analysis also demonstrates that OPBS can be regarded as a model or framework for BS, and thus, we further propose a third novel BS method named the OPBS-information divergence (OPBS-ID) method, which is a variant of OPBS."
3273,94-10,OPBS-ID can achieve a better classification performance than OPBS in many cases.
3274,94-11,"Experimental results on different hyperspectral data sets demonstrate that the proposed methods have high computational efficiency, and the selected bands can achieve satisfactory classification performances."
3275,95-1,Satellite image denoising is essential for enhancing the visual quality of images and for facilitating further image processing and analysis tasks.
3276,95-2,Designing of self-tunable 2-D finite-impulse response (FIR) filters attracted researchers to explore its usefulness in various domains.
3277,95-3,"Furthermore, 2-D FIR Wiener filters which estimate the desired signal using its statistical parameters became a standard method employed for signal restoration applications."
3278,95-4,"In this paper, we propose a 2-D FIR Wiener filter driven by the adaptive cuckoo search (ACS) algorithm for denoising multispectral satellite images contaminated with the Gaussian noise of different variance levels."
3279,95-5,The ACS algorithm is proposed to optimize the Wiener weights for obtaining the best possible estimate of the desired uncorrupted image.
3280,95-6,Quantitative and qualitative comparisons are conducted with 10 recent denoising algorithms prominently used in the remote-sensing domain to substantiate the performance and computational capability of the proposed ACSWF.
3281,95-7,"The tested data set included satellite images procured from various sources, such as Satpalda Geospatial Services, Satellite Imaging Corporation, and National Aeronautics and Space Administration."
3282,95-8,"The stability analysis and study of convergence characteristics are also performed, which revealed the possibility of extending the ACSWF for real-time applications as well."
3283,96-1,"This paper presents a multidisciplinary research on the thermodynamic and geophysical effects of crude oil released underneath thin sea ice, and further evaluates the ability of a combined frequency- and time-domain approach toward its detection."
3284,96-2,"To this end, a controlled oil release experiment in an artificially grown sea ice mesocosm was performed during the winter of 2017 at the Sea-Ice Research Environmental Facility located at the University of Manitoba."
3285,96-3,Ice cores extracted during the evolution of the sea ice prior and post oil injection allowed the investigation of the profile's properties and the oil distribution.
3286,96-4,"Furthermore, chemical composition and microstructure analysis were performed via a gas chromatography-time-offlight mass spectrometry and X-ray, respectively."
3287,96-5,The time-series radar signature of the profile was measured utilizing ground penetration radar at 500 MHz and a C-band scatterometer.
3288,96-6,"For this experiment, it was shown that the retrieval of the oil presence underneath the young sea ice layer was feasible, provided that the measured data were utilized simultaneously in a unified cost function."
3289,97-1,"Recently, a variety of approaches have been enriching the field of remote sensing (RS) image processing and analysis."
3290,97-2,"Unfortunately, existing methods remain limited to the rich spatiospectral content of today's large data sets."
3291,97-3,It would seem intriguing to resort to deep learning (DL)-based approaches at this stage with regard to their ability to offer accurate semantic interpretation of the data.
3292,97-4,"However, the specificity introduced by the coexistence of spectral and spatial content in the RS data sets widens the scope of the challenges presented to adapt DL methods to these contexts."
3293,97-5,"Therefore, the aim of this paper is first to explore the performance of DL architectures for the RS hyperspectral data set classification and second to introduce a new 3-D DL approach that enables a joint spectral and spatial information process."
3294,97-6,A set of 3-D schemes is proposed and evaluated.
3295,97-7,Experimental results based on well-known hyperspectral data sets demonstrate that the proposed method is able to achieve a better classification rate than state-of-the-art methods with lower computational costs.
3296,98-1,"Feature matching, which refers to establishing reliable correspondences between two sets of feature points, is a critical prerequisite in feature-based image registration."
3297,98-2,"This paper proposes a simple yet surprisingly effective approach, termed as guided locality preserving matching, for robust feature matching of remote sensing images."
3298,98-3,The key idea of our approach is merely to preserve the neighborhood structures of potential true matches between two images.
3299,98-4,"We formulate it into a mathematical model, and derive a simple closed-form solution with linearithmic time and linear space complexities."
3300,98-5,This enables our method to accomplish the mismatch removal from thousands of putative correspondences in only a few milliseconds.
3301,98-6,"To handle extremely large proportions of outliers, we further design a guided matching strategy based on the proposed method, using the matching result on a small putative set with a high inlier ratio to guide the matching on a large putative set."
3302,98-7,This strategy can also significantly boost the true matches without sacrifice in accuracy.
3303,98-8,"Experiments on various real remote sensing image pairs demonstrate the generality of our method for handling both rigid and nonrigid image deformations, and it is more than two orders of magnitude faster than the state-of-the-art methods with better accuracy, making it practical for real-time applications."
3304,99-1,"Ocean color data are critical for the monitoring and understanding of biological and ecological processes and phenomena, and the data are also important sources of input data for physical and biogeochemical ocean models."
3305,99-2,The Visible Infrared Imaging Radiometer Suite (VIIRS) onboard the Suomi National Polar-orbiting Partnership has continued to provide global ocean color data since its launch in October 2011.
3306,99-3,"However, there are always many missing pixels in the original VIIRS-measured ocean color images due to clouds and various other reasons."
3307,99-4,The data interpolating empirical orthogonal functions (DINEOF) is a method to reconstruct (gap filling) missing data in geophysical data sets based on the empirical orthogonal function.
3308,99-5,"In this paper, the DINEOF is applied to VIIRS-derived global Level-3 binned ocean color data of 9-km spatial resolution, and the DINEOF-reconstructed ocean color data are used to fill the gaps of missing data."
3309,99-6,"In particular, daily, eight-day, and monthly VIIRS global Level-3 binned ocean color data, including chlorophyll-a concentration, diffuse attenuation coefficient at 490 nm [K-d(490)], and normalized water-leaving radiance spectra [nL(w) (lambda)] at the five VIIRS visible bands, are tested and evaluated."
3310,99-7,"To validate and evaluate the gap-filled data, a set of original valid nonmissing pixels in the VIIRS images are selected randomly and treated as missing pixels in the DINEOF process, so that the reconstructed pixels can be compared with the original data."
3311,99-8,"Results show that the DINEOF method can successfully reconstruct and gap-fill meso-scale and large-scale spatial ocean features in the global VIIRS Level-3 images, as well as capture the temporal variations of these features."
